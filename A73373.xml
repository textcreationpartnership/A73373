         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are three ſorts of Kingdoms (right Worſhipfull) much ſpoken of in the ſacred volumes of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The firſt is the kingdome of God, as it is ruled by Chriſt the Mediator of the new Teſtament, whom the Father hath conſtituted the head of his Church. The ſecond is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Man, as he is ſet vp in authority aboue others, by the ordinance of the moſt High, to command his people at his will, and according to his lawes, of whom he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his place of Regency. The third is, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Sathan, as he is the Prince of darkeneſſe, and the

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> world, ruling in the children of darkeneſſe, and raging againſt the children of light. Of theſe three Kingdomes the firſt and the laſt are oppoſite, like the fire and the water; &amp; ſo contrary one vnto the other, that there can neuer be any good agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betwixt them, but dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hatred and enmity for euer. For this is the immutable voyce of the Almighty. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith the Lord to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell) <hi>put enmity betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy ſeed and her ſeed. He ſhall breake thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> But as for the midſt of them, it is ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vnto them both, and of ſuch a flexible nature, that it is content to participate with either ſide. For it is neither wholly for Chriſt, nor wholly for Satan; but it ſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending vnder it the whole race of mankinde, whereof ſome are good, and others bad, doth yeeld foorth ſubiects both for Chriſt, and for Satan: the children of light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubiects of Chriſt, the children of darkeneſſe the ſubiects of Satan. Thus do Chriſt and Satan hold their Kingdoms in the Kingdome of man. So that though there be three diſtinct Kingdoms, yet there are not three diſtinct places for the adminiſtration of theſe Kingdomes, but the place is but one, and the ſelfe ſame for them all. In regard whereof euery perſon muſt carefully looke to himſelfe, whether liuing in the kingdome of Man, he doth belong to Chriſt, or to the diuell. For of neceſſity he muſt be a ſubiect to the one of them, or to the other, conſidering that no man can ſerue two maiſters. If we belong to Chriſt, we are happy, &amp; ſhall haue this comfortable ſaying deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs at the laſt, <hi>Come ye bleſſed children of my Father, receiue the Kingdome of God, which is prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi> But if we appertaine to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, we are in a pittifull caſe, and ſhall haue this dolefull ſentence pronounced againſt vs at the day of iudgement:
<pb facs="tcp:173667:8"/>
               <hi>Depart ye curſed into euerlaſting fire prepared for the diuell and his Angels.</hi> Now how men do cary themſelues in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of theſe Kingdomes, &amp; what they ſhould alſo do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thereof, <hi>Dauid</hi> who was himſelfe a King, and a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prophet of the moſt High, hath notably deſcribed vnto vs in his ſecond Pſalme, which ſpendeth it ſelfe wholly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubiect. The which Pſalme of his I haue handled, &amp; preached ouer amongſt my people; but the Lord, that is the ſearcher of the heart, doth know, that whoſoeuer I be now content to let my Sermons vpon the ſame go in common for the common good of all, and to commit them to the ballance of Gods Sanctuary for the profit of his Saints; yet when I preached them at the firſt, it was neuer once inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by me, that they ſhould come to the preſſe. And therefore the whole diſcourſe was ſo framed both for matter and manner, as might beſt fit the neceſſity and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the preſent Auditory, whoſe benefite I did chiefly reſpect, and vnto whom I did accommodate my ſelfe, as in other matters, and as at other times I was wont for to do.</p>
            <p>Howſoeuer being thus penned out, in ſimplicity of ſpirit, &amp; plaineneſſe of phraſe, without all eloquence of ſpeech, and gloriouſneſſe of ſtyle, and being now ready to come to the view of the world, I make bold to preſent them vnto you (right Worſhipfull) to whom if they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any reſpect, they do belong in many reſpects. For as your loue to Chriſt, wherein you paſſe many others of your ranke and order; your office vnder Chriſt, by which you are, as it were, Kings in his Kingdome, reigning ouer other Kings: your hatred to them, which are out of Chriſt, whereby you are carried with ſome indignation againſt the Man of ſin, and thoſe which are in a confederacy with the arch-enimy of our ſoules: and laſtly, as your kind
<pb facs="tcp:173667:9"/>affection to them, which are in Chriſt, and for Chriſt, which hath moued your tongues to commend them, and your hands to helpe them, do ſeeme to challenge this worke, which doth intreate of Chriſt and his kingdom, and to claime it for their owne; not much vnlike to that of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Pomponius Atticus,</hi> who had that Treatiſe which <hi>Tully</hi> made of old age, committed to him, becauſe he was a man well ſtricken in age; or that of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to whom <hi>Luke</hi> the Euangeliſt did conſecrate the Hiſtory of Chriſt, for that he was a friend of Chriſt, and one that loued him well. So your vndeſerued fauours towards me in particular, do of right vendicate the ſame, conſidering that theſe are the firſt fruites of all my labours, which I haue taken in this ſort, and after this manner, ſince my comming to that place, where now I am, and which I receiued by your meanes; ſome of you being Commiſſioners appointing that annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtipend for the continuall maintenance of a Preacher amongſt vs, which our recouered lands will affoord; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being Patrones preſenting me to the ſame. In lieu whereof, as they are in that regard moſt due vnto you, ſo I do here preſent them vnto you, as a teſtimony of my minde, which is well affected towards you, and as a token of my thankefull heart, which would recompence you better, if I could. If you iudge them worthy, vouchſafe them, I pray you, your patronage: if not, your pardon: at leaſt your gracious and fauourable acceptance, according to the kindnes of your nature, &amp; wonted courteſie in other matters. The which thing if I ſhall vnderſtand you do, it ſhall not onely greatly reioyce mine heart, but make me much indebted vnto you for the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Lord for his Sonnes ſake grant, that this labour of mine may be accepted of the Saints, and tend to Gods glorie: And I heartily beſeech the Lord, the God of all
<pb facs="tcp:173667:9"/>grace, and giuer of all bleſſings, that he would ſo multiply his heauenly graces vpon you that you may alwaies walke worthy of the Lord, and pleaſe him in all things, battering downe continually the kingdome of Sathan, and ſetting vp the kingdome of Chriſt to the vttermoſt of your powers; that ſo many ſoules may be ſaued by your meanes, and you your ſelues haue the greater weight of glory beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon you at the day of iudgement, when all perſons ſhall be rewarded according to their workes. And ſo crauing pardon for my boldneſſe I ende, and humbly take my leaue. <hi>Rodborough</hi> the twentieth of Auguſt. 1610.</p>

            <head>SEVEN SERMONS VPON the ſecond Pſalme. Prolegomena: or the Generall view of it.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is a time</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) for all things vnder the Sunne,</hi> in <hi>Eccle.</hi> 3.1. And againe he ſaith in <hi>Prou.</hi> 25.11. that <hi>a word ſpoken in his place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.</hi> In conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I haue elected this portion of ſacred Writ, to handle here amongſt you, on theſe holy daies, as moſt fitting the time, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for whoſe ſake they are obſerued; and ſo I hope, will be moſt acceptable vnto you. For the time, (you know) is a time, that is celebrated for the honour of Chriſt our Sauiour, who was borne as vpon this day. And as for this portion of holy Scripture, it is a Pſalme that doth intreate of Chriſt, and of his heauenly kingdome; who though he hath many enimies to withſtand him, yet he ſhall remaine King and Lord for euer.</p>
            <p>The Author principall of this Pſalme was God, as he is of all the reſt of the Scripture, according to <hi>Paules</hi> teſtimony in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. But the Author miniſteriall, or inſtrumentall penman there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was the ſweete ſinger of Iſrael, bleſſed <hi>Dauid</hi> the king; as we may ſee by the prayer of the faithfull, in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25. For there in plaine termes <hi>Dauid</hi> is named, when they ſay vnto God. <hi>Which by the mouth of thy ſeruant</hi> Dauid <hi>haſt ſaid, Why did the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles rage, and the people imagine vaine things? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:173667:13"/>
            <p> The chiefe matter herein handled, is the gracious king dome of our beſt beloued bridegroome, the ſweete Sauiour of the world. In letter and type it ſpeakes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and his kingdome; but in ſpirit and truth of Chriſt and his kingdome. For that which was figuratiue in <hi>Dauid</hi> (who repreſented the perſon of Chriſt) was all of it moſt liuely accompliſhed in Chriſt, who was repreſented by him. And therefore you ſhall finde, that thoſe things which are here deliuered by the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> are applied by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God (the beſt interpreter of all) vnto Chriſt in particular, and that in three places of the new Teſtament. The firſt is in that 4. chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which was quoted before. The ſecond is in the thirteenth chapter of the ſame Booke, and the thirtieth three verſe. And the third and laſt is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. So that by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of theſe places of diuine Oracle, this Pſalme and the things therein contained, are truely and properly to be referred vnto Chriſt our King. Wherefore in the handling of it, we wil ſtand chiefly vpon him, and his kingdome, and ſpeake but a little of <hi>Dauid</hi> and his kingdome; onely ſhewing the verity of it in him, &amp; preſſing it as it were, by the way of an alluſion, and in the matter of amplification.</p>
            <p>The parts of this Pſalme are two, <hi>Doctrine</hi> (which ſome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would call, a <hi>Narratiue propoſition</hi>) and <hi>Exhortation,</hi> (which they would peraduenture ſtile, an <hi>Admonitorie Concluſion.</hi>) Of theſe two, <hi>Doctrine</hi> goes foremoſt, and <hi>Exhortation</hi> comes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, according to all good <hi>Methodicall inſtruction.</hi> For as in the architecture of an houſe, the foundation muſt firſt be well laid, and then afterward the whole building muſt be framed vpon it, and faſtened to it with ſtrong bands and ioints: So in euery order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſound <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> muſt be firſt, (like the foundation) plainely ſetting downe the truth of matters, touching faith or manners; and the <hi>Exhortation</hi> muſt follow vpon it (like the frame of the houſe) fitting euery thing to the beſt edification of the hearer, and preſſing it cloſely vpon his ſoule, with pitthy perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to worke vpon it, that ſo it may be framed, according to the image of his creator in that reſpect. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> begins at the firſt verſe, and reacheth vnto the end of the nineth verſe; at which place begins the <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and continues to the end of the Pſalme.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:173667:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> In the <hi>Doctrine</hi> two principall things (as the ſeuerall members thereof) are laid downe. The one is an Oppoſition that is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the kingdome of Chriſt, in the three firſt verſes. The other is the vanity of that Oppoſition, and the woefull eſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſtand, that make the ſame, in the ſix verſes next following. If you would know the perſons, that doe oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his kingdome, they are of all ſorts: ſome that are baſe and meane ones, that do rage and murmure againſt him, ſpoken of in the firſt verſe: &amp; others, that are noble and great ones, that do ioine hand &amp; head together to ouerthrow him, mentioned in the ſecond and third verſes. If you would know againe, how all theſe doe ſpeede, they haue ill ſucceſſe, and miſſe of their purpoſe, and runne by this meanes into moſt woefull, and ineuitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For as they ſhall neuer preuaile, but all their endeauours ſhall come to nought, ſo they themſelues (like rebels and traitours) ſhall be executed, and come to moſt fearfull and ſhamefull ends. And this is ſet out two waies. The one is in regard of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Maieſty, againſt whom they haue lifted vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and who doth take his Sons part, and will defend him in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; in the fourth, fift, and ſixt verſes. For as they can doe him no hurt, not onely in regard of his place, he being in heauen, far out of their reach who are vpon the earth; but alſo of his power, he being ſtrong and mighty, whereas they are but weake &amp; feeble; &amp; one that makes no more account of their conſpiracies, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man doth of his aduerſaries forces, whom he hath in meere contempt and deriſion: ſo he is exceeding angry and wrathfull with them, for their rebellion and treaſon; and in this anger and wrath of his he will take reuenge vpon them for it, and make them know and vnderſtand, to their ſhame and griefe, that he himſelfe, and none other, had placed Chriſt in his kingdome, and eſtabliſhed him in the throne of Iſrael, &amp; that he did not vſurpe this authority to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The other way is in reſpect of Chriſt himſelfe, who is able to right his owne cauſe, &amp; not onely to defend himſelfe in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but alſo to ouerthrow al his aduerſaries, &amp; to bring a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual &amp; vnrecouerable deſtruction vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; in the ſeuenth, eight, and ninth verſes. Where you haue two things ſet downe before your eyes to contemplate vpon. The one is a promiſe which hee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173667:14"/>doth make, to publiſh his Fathers decree touching himſelfe, and his kingdome; that ſo his enimies might be daunted the more, and by the due conſideration thereof, might be brought (if it were poſſible) to leaue off their rebellion againſt him. The other is an opening of this decree by the parts thereof, which are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber two; the one reſpecting his perſon, the other his office or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. For his perſon, he is not onely man, but alſo God, euen the naturall Sonne of the almighty <hi>Ichouah,</hi> which was, is, and which is to come: and this was proued to be ſo, as by his miracles, ſo chiefly by his reſurrection from the dead, the Lord ſhewing by that, that he had begotten him from all eternity. For his office or gouernment, he is our king, and the head of the Church. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it two things are recorded. Firſt, the largeneſſe of it in the eight verſe: wherein you may ſee, how it doth reach from one end of the world vnto the other. Then ſecondly the power and ſtrength of it in the ninth verſe, which is innincible, and bruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing downe all his aduerſaries before him. And this his power he muſt vſe and exerciſe, as for the defence of his owne faithfull and loyall ſubiects; ſo alſo for the deſtruction of the forenamed rebels, and of all ſuch as ſhall at any time conſpire againſt him. And this he is to doe by the vertue of his commiſſion from his Father the Almighty, who did ſet him vpon his throne, and beſtowed this vniuerſall and catholicke kingdome vpon him. For he doth in plaine termes enioyne him to this dutie, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt cruſh them with a ſcepter of yron, and breake them in peeces, like a potters veſſell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon this ſtableneſſe of Chriſts kingdome, wherein the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries cannot preuaile, and vpon the inuincible, and reuenging power, wherewith he is armed, able to cruſh all his enemies in peeces, as the potter doth his earthen veſſels, a ſweete exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is raiſed vp, wherein all the offenders are aduiſed to ſubmit themſelues to the Lord and his Annointed, whom before they did reſiſt, and withſtand: and that betimes without any further delay, that ſo they may not periſh, but be ſaued; in the three laſt verſes. Wherein remember you, what is required of them. In ſumme, it is nothing elſe, but a preſent repentance, or amendment of life; but the parts of it are two, as the chiefe points, wherein this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173667:14"/>or amendment of life muſt ſtand. The firſt is an heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedome and holy learning, in verſe 10. For whereas hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had bene fooliſh and ignorant of their duties, now he would haue them to be wiſe and learned, knowing all ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as doe belong vnto them, and keeping themſelues within the compaſſe of heauenly direction. The ſecond is a loyall ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſeruiceable obedience, both towardes the Father, and alſo towards the Sonne. Towards the Father in verſe 11. whom they muſt ſerue in feare, and before whom they muſt reioyce in trembling. And towards the Sonne in verſe 12. whom they muſt kiſſe in token of their loue and homage to him; and that for two cauſes, one, that they may not offend him any more, and ſo bring fearefull and ſuddaine deſtruction vpon themſelues; another, that they may pleaſe him, and ſo through his fauour and kindneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, receiue daily and plentifull bleſſings from his hands, both for this world and the world to come.</p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee in a generall view, as in a chriſtall glaſſe, what this whole Pſalme is, and how correſpondently one thing doth depend vpon the other therein. But if your memories bee fraile, and not ſtable enough to retaine the ſtampe of all theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue recited points within them; yet at the leaſt remember three of them, which are <hi>(Inſtar omnium)</hi> in the place or ſtead of all. The firſt is the reſiſtance that is made againſt the Lord and his Annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: wherein you ſhall finde all forts of perſons rebelling againſt the gracious and ſweete gouernment of our bleſſed Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus. The ſecond is the ouerthrow of that reſiſtance, and the fearefull eſtate, wherein thoſe that made the reſiſtance doe ſtand, through the powerfull and reuenging Maieſty of God the Father, and of God the Sonne, againſt whom this treaſon is committed; both which are armed with intollerable and vnreſiſtable plagues to conſume them. The third and laſt is a kinde and louing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, ſtirring vp, and calling vpon theſe traitours and rebels to leaue their treaſon and rebellion, and to become faithfull and truſtie ſubiects vnto the Lord their king; with an inſinuated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that they ſhall be pardoned for that which they had done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready amiſſe, and be rewarded for all their good ſeruice, which they ſhall doe for the time to come.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:173667:15"/>
            <p> Theſe are the three maine points, on which the whole Pſalme doth ſpend it ſelfe. Wherfore let vs alſo ſtand a little while, &amp; ſpend ſome time in the due conſideration thereof, before we come vnto the ſeuerall branches that are included in either of them.</p>
            <div n="1" type="point">
               <head>Of the firſt point.</head>
               <p>It is apparant by the three firſt verſes, that there is no eſtate, found here in this world amongſt men, but that in the ſame, ſome or other, haue ſtood vp againſt the Lord and his Annointed; for al ſorts of perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are brought in rebelling, firſt the meaner ſort, ſuch as the common people are, in the firſt verſe; then the better ſort (as we terme them) ſuch as Kings and Princes are, and the ſtates of the land, in the two next verſes. But you may demand, was this true, firſt in <hi>Dauid</hi> the ſhadow, then in Chriſt the body? The anſwere is, that it is true in reſpect of them both. For <hi>Dauid,</hi> you may ſee in the ſecond book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> from the end of the firſt chapter vnto the beginning of the twentieth one. His enemies (if you will haue the catalogue of them) were theſe. Firſt, <hi>Abner</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ner,</hi> that was Captaine of <hi>Sauls</hi> hoaſt. For he tooke <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Saul,</hi> and brought him to <hi>Mahanaim</hi> and made him king ouer <hi>Gilead,</hi> and ouer the <hi>Aſhurites,</hi> and ouer <hi>Izreel,</hi> and ouer <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and ouer <hi>Beniamin,</hi> and ouer all Iſrael. So that none did cleaue to <hi>Dauid,</hi> but the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> who annointed him king at <hi>Hebron,</hi> and did euermore take his part; and here through this contention there was a long war betweene the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Dauid;</hi> but <hi>Dauid</hi> waxed ſtronger, and the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> waxed weaker. Chap. 2. &amp; 3. Secondly, when <hi>Dauid</hi> was made king ouer all Iſrael, and <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> reſiſted him when he came vnto them, and would not permit him as it were to enter into their cittie, but with an impoſſible condition in their conceipts, ſaying vnto him: <hi>Except thou take away the blind, and the lame, thou ſhalt not come in hither,</hi> thinking that <hi>Dauid</hi> could not come thither. Chap. 5. verſ. 6. Thirdly, when he was eſtabliſhed in his throne, and had taken <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and dwelt in <hi>Zion,</hi> as in a ſtately palace, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> came againſt him, with a great army of ſouldiers to take him; but they ſped no better then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173667:15"/>the former did. Chap. 5.17. &amp;c. Fourthly, when <hi>Dauid</hi> had ſmore the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and ſubdned them, he was troubled with many other outlandiſh nations, that waged warre againſt him, as with the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and the <hi>Amalckites. Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> 11. Fiftly, when all forreine warres were ended, and the nations round about him were conquered, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them made tributaries vnto him, his owne ſonne <hi>Abſolom</hi> roſe vp in armes with all Iſrael with him (a few onely excepted) to take his kingdome from him. <hi>Chapter</hi> 15.16.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. Laſtly, when this conſpiracy of his ſonne was ended, and all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters quieted about the ſame, a wicked man named <hi>Sheba</hi> the ſon of <hi>Bichri,</hi> a man of <hi>Iemini,</hi> blew the trumpet, and ſaid: <hi>We haue no part in</hi> Dauid, <hi>neither haue we any inheritance in the ſonne of</hi> Iſhai: <hi>euery man to his tents ô</hi> Iſrael. So euery man of Iſrael went from <hi>Dauid,</hi> and followed <hi>Sheba</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Bichri;</hi> but the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> claue faſt vnto their king, from <hi>Iordan</hi> euen to <hi>Ieruſalem. Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In conſideration of all which conſpiracies and warres, <hi>Dauid</hi> might well cry out and ſay: <hi>Why doe the heathen rage, and the people murmure in vaine? The kings of the earth band themſelues, and the Princes are aſſembled together, againſt the Lord and his Annointed, ſaying, Let vs breake their bands, &amp; caſt their cords from vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for Chriſt, that theſe things are true alſo of him, the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the foure Euangeliſts doth declare: for all of them penning his life and acts, doe make mention of his troubles, and do ſhew that from his birth vnto his death, he was neuer free from one croſſe or other; but that either ſome wrong was offered vnto him through ſlanderous tongues, or elſe ſome inſurrection was made againſt him, through villanous hands. So ſoone as euer he was borne, and the wiſe men that came from the Eaſt to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> had enquired for him, ſaying: <hi>Where is the king of the Iewes, that is borne? for we haue ſeene his ſtar in the Eaſt, and are come to worſhip him;</hi> as all Ieruſalem was troubled preſently vpon it, ſo <hi>Herod Aſcalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> the king intended his death, and laid a plot out of hand which way to murther him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.2. But after he was once bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and began to goe about his Fathers buſineſſe, by preaching and working of miracles, his troubles and aduerſaries waxed more and more, and they grew to be innumerable. Few there were that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173667:16"/>did truely beleeue in him, or with a ſincere heart follow him, chiefely of the greater ſort; and therefore it is ſaid by ſome of them in <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſeuenth Chapter, and verſ. 48. <hi>Doth any of the rulers, or of the Phariſes beleeue in him?</hi> Nay, theſe made a law, that if any man did confeſſe, that he was the Chriſt, he ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated out of the Synagogue. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.22. But as for his aduerſaries, they, I ſay, were innumerable, and their dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him was too abhominable, and not to be endured; firſt for their words, then for their deedes. For their words, becauſe they did ſcornefully vpbraide him for his ſtocke and kindred, ſaying, <hi>Is not this the carpenter,</hi> Maries <hi>ſonne, the brother of</hi> Iames, <hi>and</hi> Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>and of</hi> Iuda, <hi>and</hi> Simon? <hi>and are not his ſiſters here with vs? Mark.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Then ſecondly, becauſe they did ſhamefully belye him, and lay ſlanderous things to his charge, whereof he was cleare and innocent, in that they ſaid: <hi>Behold aglutton and a drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of wine, a friend vnto publicanes and ſinners. Math.</hi> 11.19. <hi>This man caſteth the diuels no otherwiſe out, but through Beëlzebub the Prince of the diuels. Math.</hi> 12.24. <hi>He hath blaſphemed: what haue we any more need of witneſſes? Behold now ye haue heard his blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> Math. 26.65.</p>
               <p>For their deeds, becauſe they were vngratefull, inhumane, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, and bloudy. When he had preached among them at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> where he had bene brought vp, they (filled with wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him) <hi>roſe vp and thruſt him out of the citty, and led him vnto the edge of the hil, whereon their citty was built, to cast him downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</hi> (though <hi>he paſſed through the midſt of them, and went his way.</hi>) <hi>Luke</hi> 4.29. When he purged the Temple, <hi>and beganne to caſt out them that ſold and bought in the Temple, and ouerthrew the tables of the mony changers, and the ſeates of them that ſold Doues, and would not ſuffer that any man ſhould carry a veſſell through the Temple, ſaying vnto them, It is written: Mine houſe is the houſe of prayer, but yee haue made it a donne of theeues;</hi> the high Prieſts and the Scribes, and the chiefe of the people ſought to deſtroy him. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.47. When he had wrought another good worke, and had raiſed from the dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> (<hi>Maries</hi> and <hi>Marthaes</hi> brother) <hi>who had now bene dead foure daies, and began to ſtinke in the graue,</hi> as his ſiſter <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid, (yet <hi>came foorth of the graue, bound hand and foote with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173667:16"/>bands, and his face was bound with a napkin:</hi>) then gathered the high Prieſts &amp; the Phariſes a Councell, &amp; conſulted againe which way to bring him to his death. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.47. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Finally (to paſſe ouer other particulars, which happened in the whole courſe of his life) when he had done them what good he could from time to time (as appeareth by theſe his words:) <hi>Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, which killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent to thee, how often would I haue gathered thy children together, as the hen gathereth her chickens vnder her wings? &amp; ye would not. Math.</hi> 23.37. yet they (notwithſtanding the ſame,) tooke him &amp; apprehended him, as their deadly enimie, and as a malefactor, that was not worthy to liue vpon the face of the earth amongſt them any longer. <hi>Iudas one of the twelue came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and with him a great multitude, with ſwords and staues from the high Priests and the Elders of the people, and they tooke him and led him to</hi> Caiaphas <hi>the high Priest, where the Scribes and Elders were aſſembled. There he was examined by them, accuſed and condemned to death; likewiſe ſome of them there beganne to ſpit at him, and to couer his face, and to beate him with fiſts, and to ſay vnto him, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vnto vs, ô Chriſt, who is he that ſmote thee? And the Sergeants ſmote him with their rods.</hi> Math. 26.47. &amp;c. and Mar. 14.43. &amp;c. <hi>After this in the dawning of the day, when the morning was come, they led him away bound vnto</hi> Pilate, <hi>and laid most grieuous things vnto his charge; but when</hi> Pilate <hi>heard of</hi> Galile, <hi>he aſked whether the man were a</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilean; <hi>and when he knew that he was of</hi> Herods <hi>iuriſdiction, he ſent him to</hi> Herod; <hi>but</hi> Herod <hi>with his men of warre deſpiſed him, and mocked him, and arrayed him</hi> (as if he were a foole) <hi>in white, and ſent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to</hi> Pilate. Luke 23.11. <hi>Then</hi> Pilate (ouercome by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries) <hi>did at the last giue ſentence againſt him, cauſed him to be ſcourged, and to be ſent away to the place of execution.</hi> Mar. 15.15. But before he came thither, ſee what the ſouldiers did: <hi>They led him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hall, which is the common hall, and called together the whole band, and clad him with purple, and platted a crowne of thornes, and put it about his head, and beganne to ſalute him, ſaying, Haile, King of the Iewes; and they ſmote him on the head with a reed, and ſpat vpon him, and bowed their knees and did reuerence. And when they had mocked him, they tooke the purple off him, and put his owne clothes on him, and led him out to crucifie him.</hi> Mar. 15.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being come to the place of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173667:17"/>execution (which was without the citty) they crucified him, and hanged him vpon a tree, betweene two theeues. And as he hanged there (in that ſhamefull and opprobious manner, <hi>The people stood by him, and beheld him, and they together with the rulers mocked him, ſaying, he ſaued others, let him ſaue himſelfe, if he be the Chriſt the choſen of God. The ſouldiers alſo mocked him, and came and offered him vinegar, and ſaid, If thou be the king of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe. Likewiſe they that went by, railed on him, wagging their heads, &amp; ſaying, Hey, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple, &amp; buildeſt it in three daies, ſaue thy ſelfe, and come downe from the croſſe. Laſtly, one of the euill doers, which were hanged with him, railed one him, ſaying, If thou be the Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe and vs.</hi> Luke 23.35. &amp;c. and Mark. 15.29. &amp;c. In regard of all which things, we ſee that our Sauiour might iuſtly make his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint here, &amp; ſay, <hi>Why do the heathen rage, and the people murmure in vaine? The kings of the earth band themſelues, &amp; the Princes are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, againſt the Lord, and his Annointed:</hi> Come, <hi>let vs breake their bands and caſt their cords behind vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here (before we goe any further) a queſtion may be asked, to wit, why Chriſt was thus reiected by all ſorts of perſons? For a man may iudge, that euery one ſhould haue loued him, and haue reioyced greatly for him; he was ſo gentle, ſo meeke, ſo humble, ſo patient, ſo wiſe, ſo learned, ſo holy, ſo mercifull, ſo louing; and in one word, ſo willing and ſo able to do euery man good, as none in the whole world beſides him, either was or could be. We know, that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did ſing and reioyce, when ſhe knew that ſhe ſhould beare him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.46. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Angels did ſing and reioyce, when he was borne. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that <hi>Simeon</hi> did ſing and reioyce when he was brought into the Temple. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſonne, which he had by old <hi>Sarah,</hi> that was a type and figure of Chriſt, was called <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which name ſignifieth laughter, to ſhew what ioy and laughter there ſhould be about Chriſt. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.3. In conſideration whereof, the queſtion may rightly be moued, why the world ſhould thus oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt Chriſt? But the anſwere to it is this: <hi>They hated</hi> him <hi>without a cauſe,</hi> as our Sauiour himſelfe doth teſtifie of them, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.25. Some of them did perſecute him through ignorance, not knowing what he was, as we may ſee by his prayer to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173667:17"/>for them in <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. when he ſaith, <hi>Father forgiue them, for they knowe not what they doe;</hi> Alſo by the Apoſtles words, in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. <hi>For had they knowne it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they would not haue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Lord of glory.</hi> Others of them did reſiſt him of malice, and of a cankered ſtomach; they knowing well enough what he was, as is apparant by the words of our Sauiour, who doth accuſe them (for that cauſe) of the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, which can neuer be forgiuen, in <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.28. Some, laſtly, did neglect him through feare and dread, they knowing, that if they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, or confeſſe him, they ſhould be excommunicated out of their Synagogues, according to the law of the Iewes: as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant by <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.22. where we find, that the blind mans parents, for that cauſe would not confeſſe, that Chriſt had cured their ſon. And as they did thus feare trouble at home, (yea ſome of the great ones, as well as the ſmall ones, as we may ſee by the example of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who came to Chriſt by night, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2. and of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> who went ſecretly for feare of the Iewes, to <hi>Pilate,</hi> to begge leaue, to take downe the body of Chriſt from the croſſe, and to bury it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.38.) ſo did they feare trouble from abroad, as may be ſeene by their words, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.48. When they ſay, <hi>If we let him thus alone, all men will beleeue in him, and the Romanes will come, and take away both our place, and</hi> all <hi>the nation.</hi> Thus you ſee, that ſome of them through ignorance, ſome through malice, and ſome through feare did reiect Chriſt; but all of them through their owne corruptions, and naughty natures: and none of them for any iuſt cauſe that was found in Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But yet, as <hi>Daniels</hi> enemies did picke out matter againſt him, in regard of his religion: for the which they ſhould haue commended him, and not haue condemned him, as they did: ſo theſe enimies of Chriſt haue drawne occaſions of diſlike againſt him from ſundry things, for the which they ſhould rather haue liked him. In number they were 4. The firſt was his baſe eſtate, who came of meane pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, &amp; who liued in this world, as a poore ſimple man. As the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſaid, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they reiected <hi>Rehoboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> for their king: <hi>What portion haue we in</hi> Dauid? <hi>we haue none inheritance in the houſe of</hi> Iſhai: <hi>to your tents ô Iſrael, now ſee to thine owne houſe Dauid.</hi> 1. King. 12.16. As if they ſhould ſay, Why? <hi>Iſhai</hi> was but an husbandman, &amp; <hi>Dauid</hi> was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173667:18"/>but a ſhepheard; we wil not be ſubiect to ſo baſe kindred, nor ſuffer ſuch a foole as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> of their bloud, to reigne ouer vs. So theſe ſaid: <hi>Is not this the carpenter,</hi> Maries <hi>ſonne, the brother of</hi> Iames, <hi>and</hi> Ioſes, <hi>and of</hi> Iuda <hi>and</hi> Simon? <hi>and are not his ſiſters here with vs? and they were offended in him. Mark.</hi> 6.3. The ſecond was his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and fellowſhip with ſinners, and with thoſe that were publicanes. As they reiected <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> for his ſtrangeneſſe and auſterity of life, becauſe he came neither eating nor drinking, and ſaid of him, <hi>He hath a diuell;</hi> ſo they deſpiſed Chriſt for the contrary, becauſe he came eating and drinking, and ſaid of him: <hi>Behold a glutton, and a drinker of wine, a friend vnto publicanes and ſinners. Math.</hi> 11.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third was his faithfulneſſe in the diſcharge of his calling, in ſpeaking the truth, and in reprouing of men for their ſinnes. As the Prophets, and Apoſtles, loſt their liues for this, ſo did he leeſe his life for the ſame; the people ſtill hating him for it, vntil they had nailed him vnto the croſſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. The fourth and laſt was his ſtrong confidence in God, and his ſure truſt in him. As <hi>Dauid</hi> was flouted at by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries for his truſting in God, chiefly then, when God did ſeeme to forſake him, and left him in ſome troubles, they crying out vnto him, &amp; ſaying: <hi>Where is thy God? Pſalme.</hi> 42.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. So theſe did floute and mocke Chriſt, chiefly in his troubles, for his reſting vpon his Father, and his good beleefe in him, breaking out into theſe words, ſaying: <hi>He truſted in the Lord let him deliuer him, let him ſaue him, ſeeing he loueth him.</hi> Pſalme 22.8.</p>
               <p>From hence,

                  </label> that all perſons doe thus oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, we collect this doctrine (as an infallible rule) that all thoſe that do truly belong to God, and are the ſincere members of Chriſt, ſhal haue troubles &amp; enimies here in this world; according to the axiome of our Sauiour, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.20. when he ſaith: <hi>The ſeruant is not greater then his maiſter; if they haue perſecuted me, they will perſecute you alſo.</hi> The Scripture is full of teſtimonies for the confirmation of this doctrine, but I wil preſſe onely two or three. <hi>Paul</hi> writing vnto <hi>Timothie,</hi> and making mention of his owne perſecutions and afflictions, which came vnto him at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> at <hi>Iconium,</hi> and at <hi>Lyſtri,</hi> (leſt <hi>Timothy</hi> or others might thinke, that they might be free from all) he doth plainely auouch, that <hi>all that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173667:18"/>will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. In like manner when he &amp; <hi>Bernabas</hi> came againe to theſe cities now repeated, of <hi>Antioch, Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Lystri,</hi> whom before they had taught the right way of ſaluation, to confirme the diſciples hearts, and to exhort them to continue in the faith; they told them, <hi>that they must through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> Act. 14.22. Finally Chriſt himſelfe, who is truth it ſelfe, doth teach vs in <hi>Math.</hi> 10.22. that we <hi>ſhall be hated of all men for his names ſake;</hi> and that thoſe that are of our owne houſhold, and kindred ſhall be our enimies, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36.37. <hi>And that wee ſhall be here in this world, as ſheepe in the middes of wolues, verſ.</hi> 16.</p>

In regard of all theſe things, a man may well demand and aſke: Why the world ſhould hate and perſecute them? But the anſwere is, for theſe cauſes. Firſt, becauſe they are not of their number and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, being not men of this world as they be; according to the words of our Sauiour in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If you were of the world, the world would loue you, but becauſe you are not of the world, but I haue choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they are not like them in their waies and conuerſations, doing as they doe, but will be more holy and iuſt, then they are;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173667:19"/>according to the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Wherein it ſeemeth to them ſtrange, that yee runne not with them vnto the ſame exceſſe of ryot, therefore ſpeake they euill of you, which ſhall giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to him, that is ready to iudge quicke and dead.</hi> Thirdly, becauſe they reproue them for their euill waies, and doe iudge and condemne their opinions and doings, which they cannot endure to haue iudged and condemned by others; according to that in Saint <hi>Iohn Chap.</hi> 3.20. <hi>For euery man that euill doth, hateth the light, neither commeth to light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproued.</hi> But being once reproued, they cannot but perſecute them that doe reproue them, as <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> whom he did behead, becauſe he told him, that it was not lawfull for him to haue his brothers wife, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.18. and as the Iewes did <hi>Stephen</hi> the Deacon, whom they did ſtone to death, becauſe he told them their faultes. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.58.

Fiftly, becauſe they are, for the moſt part of them, poore and baſe perſons, as our Sauiour doth intimate, in <hi>Math.</hi> 11.25. where he doth reſemble them vnto babes. And as the Apoſtle doth teach vs, in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>God hath not choſen many wiſe men after the fleſh, nor many mighty, nor many noble, but the fooliſh, the weake, and the vile, and ſuch as are deſpiſed in this world,</hi> that all the glory might be his owne. For the world doth ſee, that theſe cannot enrich them, nor countenance them, nor aduance them to places of honour and dignity; but will rather be a burden and a ſhame vnto them, and therefore they haue them in great contempt and diſdaine: and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173667:19"/>doth take them for the very off-ſcum of the earth. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. Laſtly, becauſe they haue ſome infirmities, and a few of them now and then doe breake out into great and hainous offences, as into adultery, murther, theft, or the like, as <hi>Noah, Lot, Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and others haue done. For the world vpon this doth condemne them all, ſaying, that they are hypocrites, and that there is no goodneſſe in them. As I may reioyce in ſpeaking of the other cauſes of their hatred, ſo I may mourne and ſament, while I make mention of this.</p>
               <p>But to paſſe the cauſes, and to come to the vſes of the doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> here we may obſerue: Firſt, the great corruption that is in the world. For did not the whole <hi>world lie in wickedneſſe,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſay. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.19. They would neuer thus contemne the Saints of God, as they doe, ſeeing they haue no iuſt cauſe for the ſame, but many reaſons to the contrary, as was noted before. Surely the world is not worthy of them, as it is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38. Yet like blind wretches, and wicked caſt-awaies, they deſpiſe them, who yet are their ſtay and ſafety: for take away once the godly out of the world, the world would quickly come to ruine and deſtruction. The Sunne would giue no more light, the earth no more corne, the ſea no more fiſh, the heauens no more birds, the beaſts of the field no more meate, and the creatures in generall throughout the world no more obedience vnto man. For if they doe their ſeruice now vnwillingly, while the godly are liuing (whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes by good right and intereſt they are) and do ſigh and groane (in their kind) to be looſed from this burden of their bondage, as it is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. &amp;c. doubtleſſe they will refuſe altogether to do any ſeruice vnto the wicked, when they are dead and gone. The world therefore in reſiſting Gods children, may fitly be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a moath, that fretteth in peeces the ſame cloth, wherein ſhe is bred; or to a certaine worme or canker, that corrodeth and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth through the heart of the tree, that nouriſheth her: or vnto a man, that ſtandeth vpon a bough in the toppe of a tree, where there is no more, &amp; yet with an axe choppeth it off, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all falleth downe with it, and breaketh his necke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, out of this we may learne,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not to be diſmaid at our troubles, and the multitude of our aduerſaries, although ſome
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173667:20"/>ſtrange thing were happened vnto vs; acording to <hi>Peters</hi> words in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12.13. who ſaith: <hi>Dearely beloued, thinke it not ſtrange concerning the fiery triall, which is among you to proue you, as though ſome ſtrange thing were come vnto you. But roioyce in as much as yee are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall appeare yee may be glad and reioyce.</hi> It is no new thing, this is an old faſhion of the world, which it had from the beginning. It was thus in <hi>Adams</hi> houſe, in <hi>Noahs</hi> houſe, and in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, the moſt ancient houſes of all the world. For in <hi>Adams</hi> houſe, <hi>Cain</hi> hated &amp; ſlew his own brother <hi>Abel. Gen.</hi> 4.8. In <hi>Noahs</hi> houſe, <hi>Cham</hi> ſcorned &amp; deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his owne father, that did beget him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.22. &amp; in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, <hi>Iſmael</hi> flouted and reproched his naturall brother, in whom all the nations of the earth were to be bleſſed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beloued brethren, be not you grieued, when any of you are troubled and moleſted in the world for the Lords ſake. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine not, as ſome doe, who ſay, There was neuer any man ſo croſſed as I am. Thinke not, that you beare a burden alone by your ſelues: the deare Saints of God, the Prophets, and Apoſtles, together with the holy Martyrs, and others, are your companions therein. You drink of none other cup then they haue done, or your ſweet maiſter Chriſt Ieſus before you hath done. Comfort your ſelues with theſe things.</p>
               <p>Finally, let this ſerue to inſtruct you, that as you muſt be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and quiet when troubles doe come, and not fret or murmure againſt either God or man for the ſame; ſo you muſt looke for troubles and perſecutions while you are here in this world, &amp; not cry peace vnto your ſelues, as the wicked doe: you muſt thinke with your ſelues, that you ſhall haue enimies in all places, and ſuch as will be your foes in euery corner. For this is a rule of the Lords, which neuer ſhall be broken, that the ſeed of the ſerpent will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be enimies vnto the ſeed of the woman, according to theſe words: <hi>I will alſo put enmitie betweene thee and the woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thy ſeed and her ſeed,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. As Chriſt your Lord and maiſter had enimies of all ſorts, euen more in number then the haires of his head; ſo muſt you make your reckoning (if you will be like to Chriſt in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe) to haue aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all ſorts, whereſoeuer you ſhall liue or dwell. Either <hi>Iſmael</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:173667:20"/>with his flowting tongue, or <hi>Eſau</hi> with his bloudy hand, ſhall wound and perſecute you; for <hi>he that is borne after the fleſh</hi> will alwaies <hi>perſecute him, that is borne after the Spirit. Gal.</hi> 4.29. And ſurely as the life of Chriſt was a warfare vpon earth, ſo muſt your liues that are Chriſtians, be a warfare vpon earth. Here we liue in a ſea of troubles; the ſea is the world, the waues are calamities, the Church is the ſhip, the anker is hope, the ſailes are loue, the Saints are paſſengers, the hauen is heauen, and Chriſt is our Pilot. Now when the ſea can continue without waues, the ſhip without toſſings, and paſſengers not be ſicke vpon the water, then ſhall the Church of God be without trials, but not before. And as for this voyage, we begin it (or at the leaſt ſhould begin it) ſo ſoone as we are borne, and we muſt ſaile on till our dying day. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I beſeech you brethren, promiſe vnto your ſelues no ſecurity in this world, but looke ſtill for enimies; and when you haue ſlaine a Beare looke for a Lyon; &amp; when you haue killed the Lyon, looke for a <hi>Goliah;</hi> and when you haue ouercome <hi>Goliah,</hi> looke for a <hi>Saul;</hi> &amp; when <hi>Saul</hi> is wounded to death, looke for the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> &amp;c. that is, when you haue ouercome one trouble or vanquiſhed one enimie, looke ſtill for an other trouble, and for an other eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and that vntill you die, and the ſpirit doth returne to God that gaue it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="point">
               <head>Thus farre of the firſt point, now followes the ſecond.</head>
               <p>In the fourth verſe and ſo forward vnto the end of the ninth verſe, is ſhewed how this oppoſition, which was made againſt the Lord and his Annoynted, came to none effect, but was withſtood and brought to nothing, through the powerfull working of the Almighty, the enimies that made the oppoſition being brought to ſhame and confuſion. How true this was in reſpect of <hi>Dauid</hi> the figure, the 2. booke of <hi>Samuel</hi> doth declare, with the beginning of the firſt booke of the Kings. For in theſe two bookes we finde theſe three things. Firſt, that he did enioy his kingdome vnto his dying day, and that he did end his liſe quietly and in peace in his bed. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 2.10. Secondly, that the Lord his God (who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in heauen) did helpe him from time to time in all his troubles againſt his enemies. 2. <hi>Samuel</hi> 22.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, that his enemies
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173667:21"/>who did thus reſiſt him, were vanquiſhed and ſlaine. <hi>Abner</hi> he was ſlaine by <hi>Ioab.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.27. and <hi>Iſh-boſheth</hi> his maiſters <hi>Sauls</hi> ſonne (for whom he did ſight) was murdered by two of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in his own houſe, as he lay vpon his bed in his bed-chamber, 2. <hi>Sam</hi> 4.7. The <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> they were puniſhed and ſmitten by <hi>Ioab,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.8. and 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 11.8. The <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and other out-landiſh nations, they were many of them put to the ſword, and the reſidue were made tributaries to <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. <hi>Chap. Abſalom</hi> he was hanged by the haire of the head on an Oake in the wood, as he was purſuing after his father, and there he was ſlaine. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.9.14. And <hi>Sheba</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Bichri,</hi> he was beheaded in <hi>Abel</hi> by the perſwaſion of a woman, and his head caſt ouer the wall vnto <hi>Ioab.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.22. Thus all <hi>Dauids</hi> enimies ended their daies in deſerued puniſhments.</p>
               <p>But now for Chriſt, there may be ſome doubt, whether all things fell out aright, according to the text here concerning him, conſidering that his aduerſaries ſeemed to haue the vpper hand of him, in that they put him to death, and brought him to a ſhameful end; and that he himſelfe did cry out and ſay, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken mee? Math.</hi> 27.46. Notwithſtanding both theſe things, euery matter is true, which is reported here of him. For firſt and foremoſt, it is euident (howſoeuer he vttered theſe words in his agony, and bitter paſſion, through the conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his minde, which was now much diſturbed, through the intollerable burden, which God his Father did lay vpon him for the ſinnes of mankind) that God had not forſaken him, but was alwaies preſent with him for his good; firſt, by the ſending of an Angel vnto him in his great heauineſſe, for his comfort. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. ſecondly, by his hearing of him at all times, yea euen in thoſe things which he feared. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. And laſtly, by his aduancing of him from the graue vnto the higheſt heauens, &amp; the vniuerſall regiment of all the world. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is apparant, that howſoeuer they did murder him, yet they had not the victory ouer him, but he rather the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them. Firſt, by his riſing againe from the dead. Secondly, by his ſitting at the right hand of his Father. Thirdly, by his dwelling with his Church, vpon the face of the earth, vnto the end of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:173667:21"/>world. And laſtly, by his triumphing ouer his enimies eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> while he did hang vpon the croſſe; as it is well obſerued by the Apoſtle, in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. when he ſaith: <hi>And hath ſpoyled the Principallities, and Powers, and hath made a ſhew of them openly, and hath triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner them in the ſame croſſe.</hi> But if you will not giue credit to theſe things, and ſo be perſwaded by theſe reaſons, marke what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (who is truth it ſelfe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6.) hath ſaid touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.33. Where you ſhall finde him vttering theſe words vnto his diſciples, ſaying: <hi>In the world yee ſhall haue affliction, but be of a goodcomfort, I haue ouercome the world.</hi> Then as we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, yea more then conquerours, when we do ſuffer for the name of Chriſt, and do leeſe our liues for the defence of his truth, as it is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36.37. ſo was Chriſt a conquerour, yea more then a conquerour, when he died for vs, and <hi>by his death did destroy him, that had the power of death. Heb.</hi> 2.14. and ſo through his ſufferings <hi>entred into his glory. Luke</hi> 24.26. he being for that cauſe exalted aboue all the creatures, and receiuing <hi>a name, aboue euery name, that at his name euery knee ſhould bow, both of things in heauen, and things inearth, and things vnder the earth.</hi> Phil. 2.9. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, it is manifeſt, that his aduerſaries were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and that moſt of them came to fearefull ends. Firſt, by the ciuill warre, that aroſe vp amongſt themſelues, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a long time, and brought many thouſands to moſt deſperate ends. Secondly, by the grieuous famine, that was in the midſt of them, that conſumed many of them, and cauſed the parents to eate their owne children, and one friend to deuoure another. Thirdly, by the totall deſtruction of their glorious Temple, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous citty of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> with all the inhabitants thereof, by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperours of <hi>Rome.</hi> Fourthly, by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting infamy of a curſed name vpon their whole nation, in that they are reproched throughout all the world, and counted the worſt people that are, according to our prouerbe: He is as bad as a <hi>Iew.</hi> Finally, by the woeful plagues (not to ſpeake here any thing of the torments of hell, which is the worſt of all) which God hath ſent downe immediatly from heauen vpon ſome of them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as vpon <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> and others. For <hi>Herod</hi> (to paſſe ouer all the reſt, and to make him an inſtance for all) was thus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173667:22"/>plagued. Firſt, he had a moſt ſcorching &amp; burning feuer, by which he was inflamed exceedingly, as well in the inward parts, as in the outward. Secondly, there was in him an inſatiable deſire of food, which could not be abated or be remoned away by all the meate and drinke, which he did ranonouſly deuoure in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. Thirdly, he had the bloody flixe. Fourthly, he had the colicke. Fiftly, he had the goute in his ſeete. Sixtly, his priuy members did ſo ſwell and rot, that wormes did breed in the ſame. And laſtly, he was from the top of the head vnto the ſole of the foote, ſo corrupt &amp; rotten, that there came ſuch a ſtinke from him, that no perſon could well endure it; and ſo in this woefull manner he ended his life, and gaue vp the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus ſeene the truth of all matters, and found euery thing agreeable to the words of the text, let vs now deſcend vnto the doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> which may be gathered out of the ſame. In few words it is nothing elſe but this, that though we haue many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, and ſore aduerſaries, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and Chriſt had: yet they ſhall not preuaile againſt vs, but we ſhall prenaile againſt them, doe they what they can; as <hi>Dauid</hi> and Chriſt did. <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> was cruelly handled, but yet the more the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did vexe them the more they multiplied and grew, as it is in <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.12. And when they had done all the ſpite that they could doe againſt them, yet at the laſt they were deliuered out of their hands; they themſelues being oftentimes plagued by the Almighty for their ſakes, and in the end moſt fearefully drowned in the red ſea, as it is apparant in the 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the ſame booke. Mention is made of a great battell, that was fought betweene Chriſt and the diuell, and their armies, in the <hi>Reuelation, Chap.</hi> 12.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But (if you marke the ſequele thereof) you ſhall finde that Chriſt and his ſide had the victory. For as it is witneſſed of the <hi>Dragon</hi> (who is the diuell) <hi>and his Angels</hi> (who are his ſouldiers) that <hi>they preuailed not, neither was their place found any more in heauen</hi> in the 8. <hi>verſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter:</hi> ſo it is recorded to the glory &amp; comfort of all thoſe, who take Chriſts part, that they ouercame the diuell (the accuſer of Gods children) by the bloud of the Lambe, and the word of their teſtimony, in the 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> thereof, But (to omit other teſtimonies &amp; examples, whereof the holy Scripture is full and frequent in this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:173667:22"/>caſe) let the words of our Sauiour Chriſt ſuffice vs at this time: He tels vs in <hi>Math.</hi> 16.18. <hi>that the gates of hell</hi> (whereby is meant all the power and force thereof) <hi>ſhall not ouercome his Church,</hi> or be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ouerthrow ſuch, as do depend vpon him by a true and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith. And in the 7. Chapter of the ſame booke towards the latter end thereof, he doth ſhew the ſtableneſſe of thoſe that doe belong to the Lord, &amp; haue a care both to heare the word of God, and alſo to do it, by a notable compariſon, wherein he doth reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to an houſe, that is built vpon a rocke, which cannot be caſt downe by any tempeſt of weather whatſoeuer, but doth ſtand alwaies ſtill, and cannot fall. A thing neuer to bee thought of enough, it is ſo full of comfort and conſolation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery godly ſoule, chiefly vnto him that is afflicted here in this world.</p>
               <p>But what might the reaſon thereof be, may a man ſay, that thus the godly ſhould alwaies preuaile, and be neuer ouerthrowne by their enimies, but ouercome them rather? Experience doth teach vs, that they are fewer in number, then the wicked are: that they are weaker for ſtrength and power: that they are more ſimple for wit and policy: and that they are more careleſſe for diligence and watchfulnes, then their aduerſaries be. How comes it then to paſſe, that they haue the vpper hand?</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> doth declare it vnto vs in the 8. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Prophecy, and the 10. <hi>verſe</hi> thereof: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> It is in few words, becauſe the Lord is with &amp; for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For firſt he is ſtronger then all, beeing able to reſiſt all power that is made againſt his; &amp; to do whatſoeuer he will, both in heauen &amp; earth. Secondly, he is wiſer then all, ſeeing how to preuent them in all their waies, and how alſo to bring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to paſſe for the good of his. Thirdly, he is diligenter then all, to ſtand as it were vpon his watch, and to take his aduantage, when it is offered him. For <hi>he that keepeth</hi> Iſrael <hi>doth neither ſlumber nor ſleepe. Pſalme</hi> 121.4. Laſtly, he is happier then all, to haue good ſucceſſe in all his enterpriſes. For he doth proſper ſtill in all things which he doth take in hand, and none can reſiſt a thought of his: yea the very word that goeth out of his mouth, doth accompliſh that which he will, and <hi>proſper in the thing, whereunto he doth ſend it, Iſay</hi> 55.11. In warre all theſe foure things are reſpected in a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:173667:23"/>that will ſtill ouercome. Firſt, that he be ſtrong. Secondly, that he be wiſe. Thirdly, that he be diligent. And laſtly, that he be fortunate. For the victory goes not alwaies with the ſtrong, nor alwaies with the wiſe, nor alwaies with the diligent, nor alwaies with the fortunate, but ſometimes with the one of them, and ſometimes with the other. But looke where all foure doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre together, there is alwaies the victory. And therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of them are in God, it is no maruell, though thoſe, whoſe battels hee doth fight, doe alwaies ouercome, and get the victory.</p>
               <p>Here I would gladly come to the vſe of the doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> but me thinks, I heare a man obiecting againſt that, which hath bene ſaid, ſaying, that it is not true, that Gods children do alwaies preuaile againſt their enimies, but that their enimies oftentimes do preuaile againſt them. For we ſee, that they are murdered and put to death. Mention is made thereof in the booke of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the holy Scripture beſides. And thouſand exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples euery where do demonſtrate the ſame daily vnto vs. For we do behold ſtil with our owne eyes, and heare with our owne eares, that the godly haue the worſt end of the ſtaffe (as it is in our adage) and that the wicked do beare ſway and dominion ouer them. How then is it true which hath bene ſpoken, that doe the vngodly what they can, yet the righteous ſhall ſtill preuaile againſt them, as here <hi>Dauid</hi> and Chriſt did?</p>
               <p>The anſwere hereunto may eaſily be collected out of <hi>Paules</hi> words,
<label type="milestone">

For I pray tell me, is not he a conquerour, yea more then a conquerour, that doth ſo ſubdue his enimie, that he can no more riſe vp againſt him? A man may van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:173667:23"/>his enimie, and beate him cleane out of the field; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he may gather a power againſt him againe, and put him to the worſt. But here Satan, the world, and all our enimies are ſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe, and troden vnder foote by all ſuch as ſuffer and die for the truth, that they can neuer aſſault them any more, or ſtirre (as it were) either tongue or hand againe to do them any hurt. For they goe immediately vpon that their death and paſſion to heauen, and vnto all that happineſſe, which is prouided there for them, as <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſhew, in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14.13. ſaying: <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, which die in the Lord: euen ſo ſaith the Spirit, for they reſt from their labours; and their workes do follow them.</hi>

For firſt by it we may learne to take heed, that we goe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing, which may be hurtfull or pernicious vnto Gods children. For if we do, (we ſee here) our labour ſhal be in vaine; we ſhall not preuaile againſt them, but they ſhall preuaile againſt vs. He is a very foole, that will attempt a thing, which he knowes for certainty, he cannot bring to paſſe, and which he is ſure will bee his bane and deſtruction: But wee know that we cannot preuaile againſt the faithfull, and wee are ſure that our plots againſt them will turne to our ouerthrow: And therefore beware we, that we lift not vp our ſelues againſt them at any time.</p>
               <p>Againe, from hence we learne, euen ſo many of vs as do truely ſerue the Lord, &amp; feare him from our hearts, that there is no cauſe, why we ſhould feare man, or what he can doe againſt vs; becauſe the victory ſhall alwaies goe on our ſide, and not againſt vs. <hi>Oh we may reioyce and be glad,</hi> as it is required of vs in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. which places you may reade at your leaſure. Feare not (beloued) but be of a good comfort; though you haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies in euery corner, yet be not diſcouraged; you ſhall haue the conqueſt, &amp; the Lord your God ſhall deliuer you out of all your troubles, according to <hi>Dauids</hi> ſaying in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. when he ſaith, <hi>Great are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliuereth him out of them all.</hi> He is wiſe, he doth know how to do it; and he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, he is able for to do it: and as for his willingneſſe, he is ready at all times to accompliſh it, as iuſt occaſion ſhall require it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173667:24"/>be (I ſay) of a good comfort, and feare not, but truſt in the Lord, and commit your waies vnto him, &amp; he ſhall bring all things to paſſe according to your owne hearts deſire in the end. He that deliuered <hi>Noah</hi> from the floud, <hi>Lot</hi> from <hi>Sodom, Iacob</hi> from <hi>Eſau, Ioſeph</hi> from <hi>Potiphar, Moſes</hi> from <hi>Pharaoh, Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Aegypt, Elijah</hi> from <hi>Ahab, Eliſha</hi> from the <hi>Syrians, Daniel</hi> from the Lyons, the three children from the fire, <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Herod, Mordecay</hi> from <hi>Haman,</hi> and here Chriſt and <hi>Dauid</hi> from all ſorts of enimies, he, euen he, will deliuer you from all troubles. If you ſay, that your enimies are many, and that the whole world is againſt you: I will ſay againe to you with <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the king, that <hi>there are more with vs, then are againſt vs.</hi> 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 6.16. &amp; 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.7. For God and all the hoaſt of heauen is for vs. If you ſay againe, that your enimies are wiſe and politicke, and that they are able to ouer-reach you by their craft &amp; cunning, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you are but ſimple and innocent like doues: I will anſwere you with the Apoſtle, that <hi>the fooliſhneſſe of our God,</hi> who is on our ſide, <hi>is wiſer then their beſt wiſedome</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. and that he will deſtroy their wiſedome, and bring their vnderſtanding to nought, (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19.) to doe vs good. If you ſay in the third place, that your enimies haue ſo hemmed you in, and compaſſed you about, that it is vnpoſſible for you to eſcape them: I will anſwere you with the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> that <hi>with God ſhall nothing be vnpoſſible. Luke</hi> 1.37. And with the three children, <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> that God both can and will deliuer you. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17. When they ſay, <hi>Behold our God, whom we ſerue, is able to deliuer vs, from the hot fiery furnace, and he will deliuer vs out of thine hand ô King.</hi> If you ſay laſtly, that your enimies haue already taken you, and do put you daily vnto death: I will anſwere you with <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. (which place was touched before) and with <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.11. That by this meanes you doe ouercome your enimies moſt of all. For when you reſiſt thus vnto bloud, and die for the truth, you giue your enimies ſuch an ouerthrow that they neuer riſe vp againſt you any more; &amp; as for your ſelues, you enter preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, the onely place which you ſtriue for. Euen as he hath the victory moſt in this world, who doth enter into the citty, and take all the ſpoyle thereof, and doth ſo confound his aduerſaries, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:173667:24"/>they can neuer ſtirre any more againſt him. In conſideration of all which things, cleaue faſt, I beſeech you, vnto the Lord, &amp; feare no danger or perill; but reioyce in the Lord and be glad, alwaies figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the crowne of righteouſneſſe, which ſhall be giuen vnto euery one, who doth with patience waite for the appearing of our Lord Ieſus, and loue the ſame.</p>

                  </label> that God is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient God, not willing the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould conuert and liue.

               <p>Wherefore learne out of this,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> firſt to put a difference betwixt God and man: for they are very much vnlike. <hi>For my thoughts</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>are not your thoughts, neither are your wayes my wayes,</hi> ſaith the Lord: <hi>For as the heauens are higher then the earth, ſo are my wayes higher then your wayes, and my thoughts aboue your thoughts. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</hi> 55.8.9. If treaſon and inſurrection bee once made againſt the chiefe gouernour of any land, the parties offending therein are apprehended, and according to law they are executed, as tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and rebels: and all this is but well, and according to iuſtice and equity, without which, no common-wealth can ſtand or flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. But yet with God it is not ſo: though that we do dayly make inſurrection againſt him, and commit high treaſon againſt his perſon by blaſpheming his holy name, and by trampling his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſtatutes and ordinances vnder our feet; yet he doth ſpare vs, and not conſume vs according to our wicked deſerts; and as one moſt deſirous to haue vs ſaued, &amp; to become bleſſed, he doth cry vnto vs for a turning and amendment of life. Oh, who can extoll this goodneſſe of the Lord ſufficiently? ſhall we rebell againſt him, &amp; prouoke him to his face? and yet will he come and intreate vs to be reconciled vnto him? Doubtleſſe if one doth but offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs ſome two or three times in ſome matters, that do concerne our credite and profite, ſo that we grow infamous, or poore thereby; we can neuer ſoundly and throughly endure that partie againe, as we ought to do: and though he ſhould come vnto vs himſelfe to aske vs forgiueneſſe, yet we ſhould hardly euer receiue him to loue and fauour againe within our hearts; ſo cloſe would his wrong &amp; iniury cleaue vnto vs. We ſee that when the Samaritans refuſed to receiue Chriſt into one of their citties for a nights lodging, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> two of his diſciples, were by and by inflamed with great choler &amp; wrath, and they would needs haue their maiſter be reuenged vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for it, ſaying vnto him after this ſort: <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we command that fire come down from heauen, &amp; conſume the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen as</hi> Eliah <hi>did? Luke</hi> 9.54. But as for our God, we ſee here, how
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:173667:25"/>patient he is, in putting vp great rebellions and treaſons, and in calling vpon the rebels and traytors themſelues for amendment of life, that ſo they may be ſaued.</p>
               <p>Learne we therefore in the next place, that though we doe ſin and offend, yet there is mercy in the Lord to forgiue vs. For where ſinne doth abound, there grace doth more then abound, ſaith the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Dauid</hi> doth ſpeake moſt excellently of this matter, in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 103. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying: <hi>The Lord is full of compaſſion and mercy, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſſe. He hath not dealt with vs after our ſinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities; for as high as the heauen is aboue the earth, ſo great is his mercy towards them that feare him. As farre as the Eaſt is from the West, ſo farre hath he remoued our ſinnes from vs; as a father hath compaſſion on his children, ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on them that feare him.</hi> And leſt that any ſhould doubt of the pardon of his ſinnes, marke what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth ſay, in <hi>Iſay</hi> 1.18. <hi>Come now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and let vs reaſon together,</hi> ſaith the Lord: <hi>though your ſinnes were as crimſon, they ſhall be made as white as ſnow; though they were red like ſcarlet, they ſhall be as wooll.</hi> And ſurely if God doth here call vpon theſe trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and rebels to forſake their ſinnes, with an intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſaue them, if they will ſo doe; then may you not doubt, but that he will receiue euery repenting ſinner that doth come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and forgiue him all his tranſgreſſions, be they neuer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, when he doth aske pardon for them, and heartily forſake them. Wherefore though you haue ſinned greatly againſt the Lord, and haue treſpaſſed euen againſt heauen, and his Maieſty with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſonne; yet deſpaire not, but with the prodigall ſonne returne vnto him, and know that you ſhall finde mercy at his hands, as he did: and as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, and as <hi>Salomon</hi> did, and as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and as <hi>Paul</hi> did, and as many more beſides them did, whoſe ſins were great and hainous. For God hath ſaid it, who cannot lye. Yea he hath ſworne it, and bound it with an oath, that <hi>he doth not deſire the death of the wicked, but that he ſhould turne and liue,</hi> as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.11.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, from hence obſerue this vſe,
<label type="milestone">

                  </label> that if any doe periſh through his ſinnes and tranſgreſſions, he muſt not impute the fault thereof vnto God, but vnto himſelfe. For God here doth call
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:173667:26"/>men from their euill waies, that ſo they may not periſh, but be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. In all our plagues and iudgements, and in all our woes and calamities, whether in this world, or in the world to come, the Lord may alwaies ſay vnto vs, as it is in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.8. <hi>O Iſrael, one hath deſtroyed thee, but in me is thy helpe.</hi> For the Lord doth take (as it were) great paines to make vs good. <hi>What could I haue done more</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>to my Vineyard, that I haue not done vnto it? Iſay.</hi> 5.4. Wherefore accuſe God (I beſeech you) at no time, if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction doth happen vnto you, but lay the whole blame thereof vpon your owne ſelues, whoſe hearts are hard, &amp; will not repent. For God doth deſire (you ſee) your wel-fare, and not your deſtruction. And ſo at the laſt, we are come to the end of the generall view of the whole Pſalme.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Prophet intending to ſpeake of Chriſt, and of his bleſſed and gracious gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he doth begin with the conſpiracy and oppoſition, that is made againſt the ſame. And whereas there are two ſorts of perſons that doe rebell, the Commons, and the Nobles; he makes his entrance with the Commons, and afterwards he comes to the Nobles. The Commons, though all of them did conſpire and agree in the maine point of rebellion, yet they were diuided amongſt themſelues. Some of them were open enimies, and ſuch as did breake out by violence and outrage into tumults and vnlawfull inſurrections. Others were more cloſe and ſecret, murmuring in their hearts againſt his gouernement, and grudging to doe ſeruice vnto him, as vnto their Lord and King. And though all of them did thus band themſelues againſt him, and vſe meanes, as it were, to be rid from his ſubiection; yet all was in vaine, they could not accompliſh their purpoſe, but their indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours came to nought. In regard wherof the Prophet doth wonder, that euer they ſhould be ſo mad and fooliſh, as thus to attempt ſuch vnpoſſible things, and ſuch matters too, that if they were brought to paſſe, yet would not be commodious or beneficiall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. For what commodity or benefit ſhould they get, by being looſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kingdom of Chriſt? Surely, as much as an horſe doth by an heauy burden, as it is in our prouerbe. For this cauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaking of their conſpiracy, he doth not note it out ſimply in a plaine narration, but he doth declare it by way of admiration,

For the parts of it,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Parts. </seg>
               </label> they are in number two. The firſt ſets downe what they doe, the other the Prophets wondring at them for their ſo doing. Their deedes are noted out two waies. Firſt, by the parts or kinds of them; then by the effect enſuing vpon them. The parts and kinds of them are two; the one is raging, the other is murmuring. <hi>Why doe the heathen rage</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) and <hi>why doe the people murmure in vaine?</hi> By heathen, here ſome doe vnderſtand the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> and by people, the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But we may better take them for all the enimies (chiefly of the common and meaner ſort) which either <hi>Dauid</hi> or Chriſt had, without any ſuch diſtinction made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the words, or to be obſerued in regard of them. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Hebrew words here vſed, called <hi>Goijm</hi> and <hi>Leummim,</hi> and the Greeke words, as they are tranſlated in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25. named <hi>Ethnê</hi> and <hi>Laoi,</hi> are promiſcuouſly or indifferently vſed for any nation or people whatſoeuer, and the one of them is oftentimes put for the other. Secondly, becauſe the deedes here aſcribed vnto them in ſingle and apart, were iointly and mixtly found in them both. For the <hi>Gentles</hi> did not onely rage, or the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely murmure, but both <hi>Gentles</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> did rage and murmure, as we haue heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in part, and may hereafter heare more. But to leaue this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation touching that conceipted diſtinction, marke you here a true diſtinction. The enimies of our Sauiour (as we may ſee here) were of two ſorts. Some of them were violent and furious, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out into outrages, and open ſedition: and others of them were more ſecret and hidden, inwardly repining in their ſoules, &amp; outwardly muttering or whiſpering againſt him by their words. The words which are vſed here in the Hebrew tongue, and thoſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173667:27"/>alſo, which are vſed of the Apoſtles in the Greek tongue, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.25. (where the ſame ſentence is deliuered) doe make this moſt plaine and euident. For the firſt of the Hebrew words, called <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſhu,</hi> comming of <hi>Ragaſh,</hi> doth ſignifie to make a tumult, and to gather together an aſſembly; and the other of them named <hi>Iehegu,</hi> ariſing from the roote <hi>Hagah,</hi> doth import to meditate vpon, to mutter, and to ſpeake <hi>tam ore quàm corde,</hi> as well by the mouth, as by the heart. So in like manner the former of the Greeke words, called, <hi>Ephruaxan,</hi> doth ſignifie to make a noiſe, or to rage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as the horſe doth, which doth ruſh violently with great bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the battell: and the latter of them, named <hi>Emeletêſan,</hi> doth import to meditate vpon, to care for, and to exerciſe ones ſelfe in a thing. So that they were tumultuous ragers, and plodding mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee ſhortly what they did. The verity whereof may be ſeene in the ſtory of the Euangeliſts. For they with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent make mention of both theſe their facts: but let vs ſee it in a few examples. For the firſt, they raged againſt Chriſt, and met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a tumultuous manner, when they <hi>were filled with wrath, and roſe vp, and thruſt him out of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>and led him to the edge of the hill, whereon</hi> Nazareth <hi>was built, to caſt him downe head-long,</hi> and there to breake his neck. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.28.29. Likewiſe they raged againſt him, and met together in a tumultuous manner, when they came in a great multitude with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehend him, and to cary him to the officers, ſuch as the high Prieſt and others were. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.47. But to omit other times, they raged againſt him, and met together in a tumultuous manner, when they cryed out to <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaying. <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him:</hi> and when they did ſpit in his face, ſtrike him with their fiſts, ſet a crowne of thornes vpon his head, flowted him to his face, and offered other notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous villanies vnto him. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the ſecond, they murmured and muttered againſt Chriſt, when he ſate at meate in <hi>Matthewes</hi> houſe, and did eate there with Publicanes and ſinners. <hi>Math.</hi> 9.15. Alſo they murmured and muttered againſt him, when he healed the ſicke man of the palſie, and ſaid vnto him: <hi>Son be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee. Luke</hi> 5.21. Likewiſe they murmured and muttered againſt him, when he did heale and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173667:28"/>cure diſeaſed people on the Sabboth day. <hi>Math.</hi> 12.14. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (to paſſe ouer other times) they murmured and muttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, when he ſaid, that he was <hi>the bread that came downe from heauen, which if any did eate he ſhould not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting. Ioh.</hi> 6.41.60.61.</p>
            <p>As thus you haue heard, what they did, ſo now heare what was the euent of their doing. All was in vaine, but <hi>in vaine,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, by which word he doth ſignifie that all their indeauour was to no purpoſe. For a thing is ſaid to be in vaine, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought to paſſe, but ſhall lacke his effect. In Hebrew the word is in the ſingular number, called <hi>Rijk,</hi> and it doth import a vacuitie or emptineſſe, and ſuch a vanity of things as haue no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in them, no more then a dry pit hath water, or an empty houſe hath ſtuffe, But in Greeke the word is of the plurall number termed <hi>Kena,</hi> and in ſignification is all one with the former, ſauing onely, that this doth ſhew more fully as it were by the plurality of it, that all the things which they did meditate vpon in their hearts, &amp; murmuringly mutter forth with their tongues, were fruſtrated and brought to nothing, being in this reſpect like vnto ſicke mens dreames, which haue no truth or verity in them. Here might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things be obſerued. As firſt, that raging in a tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and murmuring (though) in a ſecret ſort, are diſeaſes and ſores euermore to be found among the common people, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world. Secondly, that by raging and murmuring reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is made againſt the Lord and his Annointed. Thirdly, that all attempts which are made againſt the Almighty, &amp; thoſe whom he doth ſet vp, whether by the one of theſe meanes, or by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall be broken and come to nought. Fourthly, that the multitude and vulgar ſort, are alwaies enimies to the wiſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gouernement of our God. And laſtly, that raging and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring themſelues are two notorious euils, which are alwaies to be abandoned by the holy and bleſſed Saints of the moſt High, who doe purpoſe truely to ſerue the Lord, and to go to heauen. But as a man entring into a ſhop, where is great variety of wares, will buy onely that, which is neceſſary for himſelfe and his vſes, &amp; let the reſt alone: Or as a man ſitting at a table, where are ſundry diſhes, will in wiſedome feede onely on them, which will agree
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173667:28"/>with his body beſt, and doe him moſt good; and not meddle of the reſt: So let vs ſtand vpon thoſe points alone, which are moſt commodious for vs, and may turne to our greateſt good; and let paſſe the reſt. And they are in number the two laſt; which alſo are intended moſt (if not onely) by the Spirit of God in the text it ſelfe; vnleſſe it be the third, reſpecting the vanitie of all ſuch attempts, as ſhall be made againſt the Lord, whereof wee haue ſpoken already in the generall view of the whole Pſalme, and ſo are not now againe to ſpeake thereof at this time.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, in that the heathen do thus rage, &amp; the people do thus murmure againſt Chriſt and his kingdome, as we haue heard, we gather this doctrine,
<label type="milestone">

               </label> that the multitude and the whole body of the Commons will euermore be enimies vnto the Lord and his truth: If we peruſe the writings of the Prophets, or runne ouer the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, or caſt our eies vpon the conuerſation of the whole race of mankind, we ſhall eaſily finde this to be moſt true and certaine. <hi>Noah</hi> found it ſo, when for all his preaching in ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares together, he could not conuert any vnto the Lord, but they would (notwithſtanding his preaching) continue in their ſinnes, till the floud came and drowned them all. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Lot</hi> found it ſo, when he vexed his righteous ſoule from day to day, with the vnlawfull deedes and vncleane conuerſation of the <hi>Sodomities.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.8. chiefly then, when <hi>they compaſſed his houſe about from all the quarters of the citty, both yong and old,</hi> with murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hearts, to kill thoſe men (or rather Angels) that came to lodge with him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.4. <hi>&amp;c. Aaron</hi> found it ſo, when all the Iſraelites fell to idolatry, and compelled him to make them a golden calfe, to worſhip it; or as they termed it, <hi>Gods, to goe before them. Exod.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Iſay</hi> found it ſo, when he ſaid of the whole people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they were a <hi>ſinfull nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of the wicked, corrupt children; that they had forſaken the Lord, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Holy one of</hi> Iſrael <hi>againſt them, yea they were gone backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that there was nothing found in them, from the ſole of the foote vnto the top of the head, but wounds &amp; ſwelling, &amp; ſores full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi> Iſay 1.4. &amp;c. <hi>Ieremy</hi> found it ſo, when he ſaid of the ſame people, that they were a wicked people, and that <hi>they did refuſe to heare the word of God, but would walke after the stubbornneſſe of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:173667:29"/>their owne heart, and walke after other gods to ſerue them and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them.</hi> Ier. 13.10. <hi>Dauid</hi> found it ſo, when he ſaid of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that <hi>they were all of them gone out of the way, that they were all corrupt, and that there was wone that did good, no not one.</hi> Pſalme 14.3. Finally (to omit almoſt infinite examples) <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> found it ſo, when they were at <hi>Philippy</hi> a chiefe citty in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where all were ſet againſt them both people and gouernours; and did not onely beate them ſore with rods, but they caſt them alſo into priſon, and commanded the gaoler to keepe them ſurely there from all eſcaping away. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.22.23.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you haue heard what the people do,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
               </label> euen rebell ſtill againſt the Lord and his bleſſed word. Now heare what are the reaſons of this their ſo doing, and marke what moues them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. There are many reaſons of it, but theſe foure are the chiefe and principall. The firſt is there fooliſhneſſe or ignorance. For they not knowing the Lord, nor vnderſtanding his waies aright, but being in this reſpect worſer then the Oxe that knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe that knoweth his maiſters crib, as the Lord doth complaine of them, in <hi>Iſay</hi> 1.3. they cannot but doe as <hi>Paul</hi> did in the time of his ignorance, euen oppoſe themſelues againſt the Almighty: or thoſe of whom Chriſt doth ſay, that <hi>they ſhall thinke, they do God good ſeruice,</hi> in putting his Saints to death, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.2. For this cauſe the Lord doth make his moane for the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe and ignorance of his people, as of the wel-ſpring of all their rebellions againſt him, in <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.22. in theſe words. <hi>For my people is fooliſh, they haue not knowne me: they are fooliſh children, and haue none vnderſtanding: they are wiſe to doe euill, but to do well they haue no knowledge.</hi> The ſecond is their impatiency, or angry way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, who cannot waite vpon the Lord with any patience, or beare any croſſe quietly. For this doth cary them away to horrible rebellions, as we may ſee by daily experience, and by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe; who being angry for their croſſes, and impatient of thirſt, of hunger, and other calamities which fell vpon them, they broke out into murmuring, and blaſphemous ſpeeches againſt God, and into open rebellion and inſurrection againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> their gouernours, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they had ſtoned them to death, had not God by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:173667:29"/>arme preſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.10. The third is their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe or obſtinacie. For they being, with <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> in loue with themſelues, and doting vpon their owne waies, will not hearken vnto the charmer, charme he neuer ſo ſweetly, as appeareth by Chriſts ſpeech, in <hi>Math.</hi> 11.17.18.19. But as <hi>Ieremy</hi> doth well obſerue of them, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.3. <hi>They make their faces har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then a stone, and do refuſe to returne.</hi> In regard whereof the Lord ſending foorth his ſeruant <hi>Ezechiel</hi> to preach vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he tels him, that <hi>they will not heare him,</hi> and that becauſe <hi>they are impudent children, and ſtiffe-hearted. Ezech.</hi> 2.4. The fourth and laſt, is their vnbeliefe or vnfaithfulneſſe. For as Chriſt doth well obſerue of his owne Diſciples, that they were dull of heart and ſlow to beleeue, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25: So they diſtruſting God, and not relying vpon him with a ſtedfaſt faith, do depart away from him, and commit grieuous abominations againſt him, according to that in <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.23. <hi>But this people hath an vnfaithfull and rebellious heart: they are departed and gone.</hi> So then theſe foure vices reigning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them do (like a violent ſtreame) carry them to all kind of rebellions.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of their rebellion being thus touched;
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
               </label> now let vs come to the vſes of the doctrine. They are in number foure. For firſt, here we may learne, in that all do thus rebell, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number in the world is not the beſt, but the worſt. The flocke of Chriſt is a little flocke, according to his owne words, in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. when he ſaith, <hi>Feare not, little flocke, for it is your Fathers pleaſure to giue you a kingdome.</hi> But the flocke of the diuell is a great flocke, according to that in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20.8. Where his armie, that he gathered together againſt the Saints of God, out of the foure quarters of the earth, <hi>euen Gog and Magog,</hi> is compared <hi>to the ſands of the ſea for number.</hi> Oh weigh this well, and with a religious heart, and let neither Popery tell you of multitude, which they make to be a marke of Gods Church; nor the carnall Goſpeller of the generality of the world, which they make to be the rule of their liues; but euer looke for truth and goodneſſe in the ſmalleſt number. For many according to Chriſts words, do <hi>go in at the wide gate, and broad way, that leadeth to destruction; and but few at the straight gate, and narrow way, that leadeth vnto life.</hi> Math. 7.13.14.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:173667:30"/>
            <p> Secondly, here we may learne, that we muſt not care for the loue &amp; liking of the world, nor hang vpon the multitude for their applauſe &amp; fauour; for they are againſt the Lord, &amp; not for him. Surely as they are moſt vnconſtant in their waies, turning vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſmall occaſion (like the weather-cocke at the blaſt of the wind) this day one being a man with them, to morrow a beaſt; this day none better with them, to morrow none worſe; this day a god with them, to morrow a diuell; as we may ſee by their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards Chriſt &amp; <hi>Paul:</hi> So their loue and fauour muſt needes be bent towards the worſt, ſeeing they themſelues are bad, and do oppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt the Almighty. Remember alwaies what Chriſt ſaid vnto his Diſciples about this matter: <hi>If ye were of the world,</hi> (ſaith he, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.19.) <hi>the world would loue his owne: but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I haue choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Wherefore as they that runne at tilt looke to the iudges what they ſay, and not what the vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay: ſo I beſeech you, looke you euer what your iudge in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doth allow, or approue; and care not what the world, and the people thereof, do thinke or ſay.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here we may learne, that the multitude, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people will be enimies vnto you, and labour to reſiſt you, whenſoeuer you ſhall go about to ſerue the Lord aright. If you ſhall once begin to ſeeke Chriſt, and to come vnto him, they ſhall ſtand in your way to hinder you, as they did ſtand in <hi>Zacheus</hi> way when he went foorth to ſee Chriſt. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.3. If you be once in his preſence, &amp; do begin to call vpon him for mercy &amp; helpe, they wil rebuke you, as they did the poore blind man, who cryed vnto him, ſaying: <hi>Ieſus the Son of</hi> Dauid, <hi>haue mercy on me Luke</hi> 18.39. If you be ſicke or dead in your ſins &amp; treſpaſſes, and Chriſt doth begin to come home to the houſes of your ſoules, to heale you, and to raiſe you vp from the death of your ſins; they will ſtop his paſſage and entrance in, if they can, as they did, when Chriſt came to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers houſe to heale his daughter that was ſicke, yea dead, when he came <hi>Math.</hi> 9.23. But as Chriſt turned them there out of dores, ſaying, <hi>Get you hence:</hi> ſo muſt you ſhake them all off, and not communicate with fleſh &amp; bloud in the matters of your God. But do as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: when he ſacrificed to God, the fowles of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:173667:30"/>the heauen fell on the carkeiſes, which he had prepared for the ſacrifice, but he droue them away, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.11. So if any do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to moleſt you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are going about any ſpirituall ſacrifice, reſiſt them, and driue them away, ſaying with Chriſt vnto <hi>Peter: Auoid ſatan. Math.</hi> 16.23.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, here we may learne, to take heede of the people, and in any caſe not to do as they do. For ſeeing that they do rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord; and <hi>the whole world</hi> (as <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſay 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.19.) <hi>doth lye in wickedneſſe:</hi> we muſt not follow them, nor go after their waies, to prouoke the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt vs, as they do. <hi>Faſhion not your ſelues</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) like vnto this world, but bee yee changed by the renewing of your minds, that you may proue what is the good will of God, and acceptable, and perfect.</hi> Rom. 12.2. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and multitude muſt not mooue vs. For what ſaith the Lord? <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to doe euill, neither agree in a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie to decline after many, and ouerthrow the truth. Exod.</hi> 23.2. Wherfore do, I beſeech you, as Wiſedome doth counſell vs for to do: <hi>If ſinners do entice</hi> vs to go with them, let vs <hi>not walke in the way with them,</hi> but <hi>refraine our feete from their paths.</hi> Prou. 1.15. And, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth require of vs, let vs <hi>not be companions with them, nor haue any fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkeneſſe, but</hi> let vs <hi>rather reprooue them.</hi> Epheſ. 5.7.11.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Hitherto of the firſt point. Now followes the ſecond.</head>
               <p>In that this their rebellion was wrought by raging and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and theſe were the chiefe heads thereof,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                  </label> we are taught this doctrine, that raging and murmuring are two great and notorious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, alwaies to bee auoided by euery good Chriſtian, and thoſe that would be the faithfull children of the moſt high God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But on the former of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I will not now ſtand, partly becauſe all do confeſſe that to be a moſt hainous offence; and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſomewhat cleare and innocent from it: but I will ſtand onely vpon the latter, as vpon a thing more doubtfull, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are intangled moſt. The which to be a moſt grieuous ſin in the ſight of the Almighty (howſoeuer man doth iudge lightly of it) appeareth euidently by three things. Firſt, by his often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of it in his word. Secondly, by his branding of them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:173667:31"/>with a note of great infamie, or reprobation, who were ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. And thirdly, by his ſeuere puniſhing of them, who were guilty in it. If we peruſe the word, we ſhall finde many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces condemning the ſame, but I will preſſe two or three alone. <hi>Do all things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>without murmuring and reaſonings.</hi> And againe, writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. he ſaith, <hi>Neither murmure ye, as ſome of them alſo murmured</hi> (making mention there of the Iſraelites) <hi>and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Peter</hi> well agreeing with him, ſaith, in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Be ye harborous one to another without murmuring.</hi> If we ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we ſhall finde againe, that murmurers therein are brought in as the leawdeſt and vileſt people that be. <hi>Iude</hi> in his Epiſtle, ſpeaking of vngodly perſons, who are a ſtaine vnto true religion, euen of ſuch as were ordained of old vnto eternall condemnation, as appeareth in the 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> of that Epiſtle, doth amongſt other things ſet them out by this marke, that they <hi>are murmures</hi> and <hi>complainers, walking after their owne luſts,</hi> as it is in the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> thereof. Whereby we ſee that God doth brand them with the note of reprobation, as I ſaid before: In like manner, as <hi>Kain</hi> is recorded to be a murtherer, a runnagate, a vagabond, and a damned wretch, who was a murmurer, and one that did repine and grudge, that God ſhould reſpect his brother <hi>Abel</hi> aboue himſelfe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So are all the Iſraelites, who did ſo often murmure and grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord and <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſeruant in the wilderneſſe, reputed for moſt vile and notorious ſinners, and that by God himſelfe, in theſe words; <hi>Forty yeares haue I contended with this generation, and ſaid, They are a people that erre in heart, for they haue not knowne my waies. Wherefore I ſware in my wrath,</hi> ſaying: <hi>ſuerly they ſhall not enter into my reſt.</hi> Pſal. 95.10.11. Laſtly, if we carefully obſerue the ſtory of ſacred Oracles, we ſhall find that moſt heauy plagues &amp; iudgements haue bene excuted vpon offenders in this reſpect. But to touch one or two, it is not vnknowne, that though <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> were an excellent woman, and one of great account amongſt all the people of God; yet the Lord did not ſpare her, but did ſtrike her with the Leproſie (a curſed &amp; an odious diſeaſe) for her murmuring againſt <hi>Moſes. Numb.</hi> 12.10. Againe, it is apparant that though God made choiſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be his people before all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:173667:31"/>the nations of the world, and did carry them, as it were, in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as a mother doth carry her child in her boſome; yet he did deſtroy many thouſands of them by the <hi>Amalekites</hi> &amp; the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> that dwelt in the mountaine of their wandring, for their murmuring and repining; yea and more then that, hee debarred them all from entring into <hi>Caanan,</hi> that came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two, <hi>viz. Ioſuah</hi> and <hi>Caleh,</hi> as we may ſee at large in the 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Numbers.</hi> But yet his hand ſtaid not there. For beſides all that, he caſt moſt of them downe to hell, and would not ſuffer them to come to heauen (which is the plague of all plagues, and the heauieſt iudgement that can be) as the Apoſtle doth obſerue, in the 3. and 4. <hi>Chapters</hi> of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As thus you heare that murmuring is a ſinne,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> ſo peraduenture you would gladly vnderſtand the cauſe why it is a ſinne? In few words, it is a ſinne for two cauſes. The one is, becauſe it hath an errour in it, whereby we iudge amiſſe of the Lord and his wayes, whether workes or words. For whenſoeuer we murmure for any matter, we iudge and thinke, that that matter is out of order, and that it might be better diſpoſed of then it is. As for example, when the maiſter of the vineyard gaue vnto euery one a penny at night, that laboured in his vineyard, the enuious man grumbled at this; becauſe he thought here was no iuſtice and equity obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in that all of them were made equall in their wages, who were vnequal in their labours. So when we murmure againſt God, we do diſlike with ſomething in God, and ſo we do controll him, and preferre our ſelues, who are fooliſh and wicked, before him, who is moſt wiſe and holy: as though we our ſelues in the like caſe could do better then God hath done; then which blaſphemy what can almoſt be more hainous? The other cauſe is, becauſe it hath ſome rebellion in it, as a curſed effect, ariſing from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of that former cauſe, whereof we haue already ſpoken. For when the ſoule is thus corrupted with a wrong iudgement, the heart, that begins to boyle and riſe againſt God in many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and fooliſh paſſions; and the tongue oftentimes is looſed with moſt vile and reprochfull words: that I may not ſpeake of the hands and the reſt of the members, all which are much out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by this meanes, and carried ouer to a ſea of corruptions; as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:173667:32"/>we may ſee in thoſe murmurers, (and many others) who were mentioned before. Wherefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> went about to draw the people from their murmuring, he wils them to <hi>rebell</hi> no more; as though to murmure &amp; to rebell were all one. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. And when God doth reproue them, he doth demand, <hi>How long they will prouoke him, and how long it will be yer they doe beleeue him?</hi> in the 11. <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chapter:</hi> as though there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene murmuring, and prouoking of God, or not beleeuing in him. So that then if it be an abhomination before the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the innocent in our thoughts, and to rebell againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the land, it is apparant and euident, that murmuring muſt needes be a great ſinne, ſeeing it hath theſe two great euils in it; the one of iudging amiſſe of the Lord; the other of rebelling againſt his maieſty. But to paſſe the cauſes, let vs come to the vſes. They are in number two.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them ſheweth the great impiety of our land;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> for ſeeing that murmuring is a great euill, and we haue murmurers in euery place, and amongſt all eſtates, we may ſee that our land is wicked and naught. In it reigne many ſinnes, as ſwearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whoring, theeuing, quaffing, gormandizing, contempt of the word, and the faithfull embaſſadours thereof, with many other notoriousvices, ſuch as couetouſneſſe and the like are: But yet in generall amongſt all eſtates from the higheſt vnto the loweſt, there is none ſo common and obuious as this of murmuring is. Go we in any place, and the ſound thereof will by and by pierce our cares. Not to ſpeake of the higher powers (for to ſpeake of them, is to touch the diſeaſe called <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> which many too raſhly and without wiſedome do venture often to touch. God make them wiſer, and more ſtaid in their proceedings.) We haue theſe murmurers amongſt vs. Firſt the Papiſts; they murmure, becauſe they cannot haue their religion eſtabliſhed, or their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to vſe their conſciences as they would. Secondly, the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts (or the Separatiſts, as they call themſelues:) they murmure, becauſe they cannot haue our Church reformed according to their plat-forme. Thirdly, the loyall ſubiects, they murmure, becauſe the good and wholſome ſtatutes of our land for iuſtice and piety, lye dead without execution. Laſtly, (not to touch the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:173667:32"/>of the Church, in regard whereof there are too many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings on euerie ſide) euery eſtate almoſt doth murmure one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, as the rich againſt the poore, and the poore againſt the rich, and the like; and there is no man almoſt that is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his place, and with thoſe things which do happen vnto him here in this life, but he doth murmure againſt God the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of all things, and that becauſe he is oftentimes croſt, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue his will fulfilled, as he would. In regard of all which we ſee what a leaprous diſeaſe hath ouer-ſpread it ſelfe vpon the whole nation, and the people of our land; the Lord herein be mercifull vnto vs, and giue vs grace to repent, and to amend this euill of ours, that ſo we may ceaſſe from murmuring, and fall to praying, and prouoke him no more to wrath after this manner, as we haue done.</p>
               <p>But to come to the ſecond vſe,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋerſ. </seg>2</label> here let vs learne to fall into a deadly deteſtation of this euill of murmuring, wherewith we are ſo tainted; and vtterly to caſt it off, as the deſtruction of our ſoules, conſidering that it is ſo vile, and ſo abhominable a ſinne before the Lord our good and gracious God. For ſhall not we hate that which he doth hate, and caſt that away, which otherwiſe will caſt vs away! I beſeech you brethren, thinke vpon this matter, and lay it cloſe vnto your ſoules. A grieuous ſinne it is, and a foule fault in any (as you haue heard;) but in a people ſo bleſſed as we are, with many happy experiences of care and loue, of might and mercy in our all-ſufficient God, it is much more damnable, and odious then in others. Murmure not therefore, nor repine, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer matters do fall out with you. Be you reſtrained of libertie? be you touched with pouertie? be you pinched with penury? be you blotted with infamie? be you croſſed by your neighbours? be you reſiſted by your aduerſaries? be you plagued by your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? be you dealt with wretchedly by your ſeruants? be you impoueriſhed in your goods? be you ſicke or lame in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? be you, in one word, caſt into the furnace of any of Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions? yet fret not, neither murmure nor grudge, but commit your wayes to God, and truſt in him, and he ſhall bring all things to paſſe for your good and comfort in the end. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. But this is, you may ſay, a worke of all workes; ô for Gods loue, teach vs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:173667:33"/>how to do it: for we are willing to do it, but we know not how to do it. Marke then theſe rules, which do follow. For if you ſhall obſerue them carefully, and lay them vp deeply in the bottome of your hearts, they ſhall be as good Triacle or Mithridate to do you good, and a ſound antidote to expell the ranckneſſe of this poyſon of murmuring, whenſoeuer any croſſe or affliction doth fall vpon you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt know and marke, that God hath a working in all things, and that croſſes and calamities do as well come from him, as bleſſings and benefits, according to the words of <hi>Amos,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Shall there be euill in the citie, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> (he meanes the euill of puniſhment, and not the euill of ſinne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is not the author of this, as <hi>Iames</hi> doth teach, but he is of the other.) For this ſhould quiet our minds, and make vs dumbe, according to <hi>Dauids</hi> words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. when he ſaith, <hi>I ſhould haue bene dumbe, and not haue opened my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it,</hi> ſpeaking there to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you muſt know and marke, that as God doth all things, ſo God hath an abſolute power ouer all his creatures to do with them what he will himſelfe, and not what ſhall ſeeme good vnto the creatures themſelues, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach vs in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20.21. ſaying: <hi>O man, who art thou, which pleadeſt againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? hath not the potter power ouer the clay to make of the ſame lumpe one veſſell to honour, and another vnto diſhonour?</hi> For this ſhould quiet our mindes and make vs dumbe, according to <hi>Elies</hi> wordes in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. when he ſaith, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, you muſt know and marke, that as God doth all things, and hath abſolute power ouer all his creatures to do with them as he will, ſo God doth wrong none, or offer iniurie vnto any, as man doth; but all his workes are iuſt and righteous, euen when he doth ſtrike, as well as when he doth bleſſe, as <hi>Daniel</hi> doth acknowledge of him in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.14. ſaying: <hi>For the Lord our God is righteous in all his workes which he doth.</hi> For this ſhould quiet our minds and make vs dumbe, according to <hi>Iobs</hi> example, in <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.21. when he ſaith, <hi>Naked came I into this world, and naked ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173667:33"/>againe; the Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken away; O bleſſed be the name of God.</hi> And <hi>in all this did not</hi> Iob <hi>ſinne</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>nor charge God fooliſhly;</hi> as conſidering herein with himſelfe, that God dealt but iuſtly and vprightly with him in taking that from him, which before he had beſtowed vpon him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, you muſt know and marke, that as God doth all things, hath abſolute power to do what he will, and all his works are iuſt and righteous, ſo euery man is ſo ſinfull, that his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and ſinnes do deſerue farre greater plagues and iudgements then any that God doth lay vpon men here in this world, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> doth inſtruct vs, ſaying: <hi>The Lord hath not dealt with vs after our ſinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities,</hi> in Pſal. 103.10. For this ſhould quiet our minds, and make vs dumbe, according to <hi>Iobs</hi> words in <hi>Iob</hi> 39.37. when he ſaith, <hi>Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand vpon my mouth.</hi> Doth a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of vs but ten ſhillings, when we do owe him an hundreth pounds? or doth an officer giue vs but one ſtripe, when by a iuſt and mercifull law he may giue vs fortie? then we haue no cauſe in the world to murmure againſt them for it, but to thanke them. So beloued, ſeeing that God doth but lightly touch vs with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when he may preſſe vs downe with his whole hand; and doth but fatherly chaſtiſe vs with a few ſtripes here, when he might caſt vs downe into hell, and there keepe vs in vnſufferable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for euermore; ſhall we murmure and grudge againſt him for this his dealing? no, no, we muſt not do ſo, but like good and faithfull children we muſt bleſſe his glorious name moſt heartily for it, and cry our with <hi>Ieremy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It is the Lords mercies, that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions faile not.</hi> Lament. 3.22.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, you muſt know and marke, that as God doth deale more fauourably with vs, then we do deſerue, he ſparing vs, as a father doth his child; ſo he doth neuer lay any more vpon vs, who are his children, then we can beare, as the Apoſtle doth ſhewe in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. ſaying: <hi>God is faithfull, which will not ſuffer you to be tempted aboue that you be able to beare, but will euen giue the iſſue with the tentation, that ye may be able to beare it.</hi> For this ſhould quiet our minds, and make vs dumbe, according to the example of Chriſt: who, being heard of his Father in the thing which he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173667:34"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. went to his death and paſſion without all murmuring, quiet, and dumbe, as a ſheepe is before the ſhearer. <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.7.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, you muſt know and marke, that as God will proportion out our burthen according to our ſtrength and abilitie to beare it, ſo he will turne all thoſe croſſes and burthens, which he doth lay vpon vs, to our beſt in the end, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth well obſerue in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. ſaying: <hi>Alſo we know that all things worke together for the beſt vnto them, that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpoſe.</hi> For this ſhould quiet our minds, and make vs dumbe. For we do loue and like thoſe things which turne to our profit, and we do reioyce in them greatly. He is a mad man, that being either ſicke or lame will fret and chafe at the Phiſition and Surgion, when they come vnto him with vndoubted remedies to make him well within ſome day or two. So not much better are we, if we ſtorme and fret at thoſe things, which the Lord doth lay vpon vs, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that they ſhall turne to our good and comfort. But hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you perceiue not how this may be, that afflictions ſhould turne to our beſt. Marke it then, they do it two wayes; one way by pulling vs from our ſinnes, and cauſing vs to be more holy, as you may ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10.11. where the Apoſtle doth ſay, that <hi>God doth chastiſe vs for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſſe; and that though no chaſtiſing for the preſent ſeemes to be ioyous, but grieuous; yet afterward it bringeth the quiet fruite of righteouſneſſe vnto them, which are thereby exerciſed.</hi> Which to be moſt true, we may ſee by the examples of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and the prodigall ſonne, both which could neuer be tamed, till miſerie came vpon them; but then they began to relent and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Lord: as alſo by <hi>Dauids</hi> teſtimonie of himſelfe, who ſaith, <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I keepe thy word.</hi> And againe, <hi>It is good for me, that I haue bene afflicted, that I may learne thy ſtatutes.</hi> Pſal. 119.67. &amp; 71. The other way is by increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our glorie in the heauens aboue, as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paule</hi> doth declare in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. ſaying, <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, cauſeth vnto vs a farre more excellent, and an eternall weight of glorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly, you muſt know and marke, that as you r croſſes and calamities ſhall be beneficial vnto you, and turne to your beſt;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173667:34"/>ſo they ſhall not continue ſtill, but ſhall haue an end; as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth inſtruct vs in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. ſaying, <hi>For the rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt on the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hand vnto wickedneſſe.</hi> And againe he doth ſay, that <hi>weeping may abide at euening, but ioy commeth in the morning.</hi> Pſal. 30.5. For this ſhould quiet our minds, and make vs dumbe. For if apprentices ſhall hold out in their hard labour, and courſe fare, for ſeuen yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or more, and all that time ſhall be ſeruiceable vnto their maiſters without open murmuring and repining, becauſe they ſee that their bondage will not laſt for euer, but after theſe yeares are exſpired will haue an end; much more ſhould we bridle our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience, ceaſſing from all mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and repining whatſoeuer, conſidering that we ſee and know that our afflictions will haue an end, and not continue for euer.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, you muſt know and marke, that all our murmuring will do vs no good, but procure much hurt, and more woe vnto vs. For God will deale with vs, as we are wont to deale with our children; the more that they ſtorme and rage againſt vs, the more ſtripes we giue them, and the leſſe countenance we ſhew vnto them; but when they do ſubmit themſelues, and cry vs mercy, then we ſtay our hand, and take the rod, and burne it. So is it with God, the more we fret and chafe againſt him, the more he doth beate vs, and the ſourer he doth looke vpon vs: but when we ſtrike vpon the thigh, and come with the prodigall ſonne, to confeſſe our fault, and to leaue the ſame, all his anger is turned ſtraite into loue and fauour; and then the fat calfe is not good enough for vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we haue a ſweete kiſſe, and other beauenly ioyes prouided for vs beſides that. For this ſhould quiet our minds, and make vs dumbe. For what wiſe man will do that, which cannot hurt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but will greatly hurt himſelfe? Remember we here what <hi>Seneca</hi> writeth of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who hauing appointed a great feaſt for his Nobles and friends of all degrees, and it falling out that the day was ſo extreme foule, as nothing could be done, he being highly diſpleaſed at it, in extreme madneſſe willed all them that had bowes, to ſhoote vp their arrowes at <hi>Iupiter</hi> (whom the heathen tooke for a chiefe god) in defiance of him, for that foule weather.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:173667:35"/>Which when they accordingly did, their arrowes lighted ſhort of heauen, and fell downe vpon their owne heads, and hurt a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them very ſore. Euen ſo do our murmuring and muttering words, either for this or for that which God ſendeth, not hurt him, but wound our ſelues both deeply and dangerouſly. Wherefore (to conclude this point) in conſideration of all theſe things now rehearſed, take heed of murmuring, auoide it, and refraine from it. Do you neither murmure againſt the Miniſters of the word, nor againſt the Magiſtrates of the land, nor againſt him that ſits vpon the throne, who is the breath of vs all; (for to murmure againſt any of theſe, is to murmure againſt God himſelfe, becauſe all of them haue their calling from God, and do ſupplie his roome and place:) nor againſt any worke or word of the Almightie, whether you be in aduerſity or in proſperity; but be quiet, &amp; waite vpon the Lord, praying alwayes for the redreſſe of things that are amiſſe, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer murmuring for any thing. And ſo I paſſe from the acts of the people, and come to the Prophets wondring at the ſame.</p>
               <p>He doth demand and aske the queſtion, ſaying, <hi>Why do the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then rage, and the people murmure in vaine?</hi> And this he doth by way of admiration, as wondring at them for this their ſo doing. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we aske a queſtion, when we doubt of a matter or know it not. So the Apoſtles asked of Chriſt, why he did ſpeake to the multitude in parables. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.10. Sometimes we aske a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, when we know a thing our ſelues, and would gladly teach it to another. So one of the Elders whom <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw ſtanding about the throne of God, asked of <hi>Iohn,</hi> what they were, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence they came, which ſtood before the throne, and before the Lambe, clothed with long white robes, and palmes in their hands. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 7.13. Sometimes we aske the queſtion for neither of theſe ends, but to tempt or to entrap. So the Herodians asked Chriſt, whether it were lawfull to giue tribute to <hi>Caeſar</hi> or no. <hi>Math.</hi> 22.17. Sometimes we aske a queſtion, when we would checke or reproue one for ſome thing, which is either ſpoken or done amiſſe. So God asked of <hi>Caine,</hi> where his brother <hi>Abel</hi> was. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.9. Sometimes we aske a queſtion, when we would expreſſe a thing with the greater force and vehemency. So <hi>Paul</hi> asked of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> how they <hi>that were dead to ſinne, ſhould yet liue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:173667:35"/>therein, Rom.</hi> 6.2. Sometimes we aske a queſtion, when we would ſtop his mouth that doth propoſe vnneceſſary or vnpleaſing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto vs. So Chriſt asked the chiefe Prieſts and Elders of the people, whether the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> were from heauen, or from men. <hi>Math.</hi> 21.25. Sometimes, laſtly, we aske a queſtion, when we maruell or wonder at a matter. So <hi>Dauid</hi> asked what man was, that God did ſo regard him, and extoll him aboue the reſt of his creatures. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4. Thus you ſee, that queſtions are propoſed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſundrie conſiderations, and for diuerſe ends. But the end why the Prophet here doth propoſe this queſtion is for wondrings ſake; for he ſaw ſuch madneſſe and fooliſhneſſe in the heathen and people for their raging and murmuring againſt the Lord, that he could not but maruell and wonder at the ſame. If a man ſhould attempt a thing, that is either vnpoſſible to be done, as to cary a Church vpon his backe; or elſe which being done, will be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurtfull vnto him, as to kicke his heeles againſt ſharpe nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles; we ſhould wonder and maruell at him much for it, &amp; thinke that he were mad, and out of his wits. So was it with the Prophet in this caſe; he ſaw firſt, that they went about a thing impoſſble, &amp; that which could neuer be brought to paſſe; for who can remoue the Lord out of his throne? or diſplace him out of his kingdome? none, no not all the inhabitants of the world. Againe, he ſaw in the ſecond place, that as this was impoſſible, ſo it was a thing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnprofitable for them, and moſt hurtfull in euery reſpect. For whether we reſpect <hi>Dauid</hi> or Chriſt, they could not haue the like king againe in all the world. For as it is recorded of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he was <hi>a man according to Gods owne heart,</hi> and that he <hi>executed iudgement and iuſtice vnto all his people,</hi> as it is in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.15. ſo it is chronicled of Chriſt, that he was the very ingraued forme of his Fathers perſon; and that the ſcepter of his kingdome was aſcepter of righteouſneſſe, he louing righteouſneſſe, and hating iniquitie. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.8.9. And as though this were not a commendations great enough of him, that he ſhould reigne as a king and prophet, &amp; <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iudgement and iustice</hi> in the earth, marke what the Lord doth adde further to this, in <hi>Ier</hi> 23.6. when he ſaith: <hi>In his dayes</hi> Iudah <hi>ſhall be ſaued, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely; and this is the name whereby they ſhall call him, The Lord our righteouſneſſe:</hi> that ſo thereby we might know, that all thoſe are in a moſt happie eſtate, who are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:173667:36"/>him, and his dominion. In regard of both which things, you may ſee, that the Prophet might well wonder and maruell (as here he doth) at their rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whereout ſhortly obſerue this doctrine, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> That the acts of the world, and the people thereof, are ſuch often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that a wiſe and godly man (ſuch as the Prophet was) may well wonder and maruell at them. It is noted in <hi>Eſay, cap.</hi> 59. <hi>v.</hi> 16. that <hi>God himſelfe did wonder at the dealing of the world, that there was no man found in it, that would offer himſelfe to helpe the Church,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>And when he ſaw, that there was no man, he wondred that none would offer himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what may the reaſon of this be,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> that we may draw quickly to an end? In few words, it is this, becauſe they haue no good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nor reaſon for that which they do, but either haue or might haue many good reaſons to the contrary. The which thing we may ſee, as in other things, ſo in the conſpiracy of our traytors, whether againſt our former Queene of bleſſed memory, or againſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King of holy reputation. For I dare proteſt, that none of them had euer any iuſt cauſe giuen vnto them, whereby they might be moued to their treaſon or rebellion, but they had many excellent reaſons ſtill to ſtay them from it; as their peace, their wealth, their honor, and the like, which they did alwaies in great abundance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy: but chiefly the word of God, which did charge them, not to <hi>touch the Lords annointed</hi> (no not though the had bin perſecuted to the death, as <hi>Dauid</hi> in a manner was by <hi>Saul;</hi>) &amp; daily experiences, by the which they did ſee, that all their plots fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time were euermore in vain, &amp; did ſtill turne to their own ruine &amp; deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

But out alas! they do it as well as the former; they haue the like treacherous and rebellious hearts within them. For they band themſelues together with all their power and ſtrength. But yet there is ſome difference betwixt them. For theſe go (as it were) warily to worke, and are very circumſpect in their wayes: they take deliberation and time, they haue their meetings and conſultations, they lay their heads together, and take aduice what is beſt to be done. But in the end they conclude vpon this: That they will be ſubiect no longer to Chriſt, and his kingdome, nor ſuffer themſelues to be bridled any more by his lawes; which they accounted to be an intollerable burthen, and ſuch bands and cords as were not in any caſe to be endured, but to be broken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, and to be caſt behind their backes, like dung and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which they could not abide to looke on.

Their words in the third verſe, containing an exhortation in them, and the matter whereunto they do exhort. Of theſe we will ſpeake in order, and ſay ſomewhat of each of them by Gods good grace.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt of them, which doth concerne their deeds, we will obſerue this methode in handling the ſame, that firſt we will ſee the meaning of the words, then the truth of the ſtorie, and laſtly the vſe and benefit, that we may make thereof. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words ſtandeth thus. By <hi>Kings</hi> are vnderſtood ſuch as were in higheſt place and authoritie amongſt men; and by <hi>Princes,</hi> ſuch as were next them for rule and gouernment ouer the people: but by them both, are vnderſtood all perſons whatſoeuer of chiefe place and ſtate for this world, by the figure called <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> when ſome ſorts or kinds are put for all. Howſoeuer theſe are here ſayd to <hi>band themſelues,</hi> and to <hi>be aſſembled together,</hi> but in <hi>Acts chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. they are ſayd to <hi>aſſemble,</hi> and to <hi>come together;</hi> the reading is ſomewhat diuerſe, but yet it is all one in ſence. For the meaning is nothing elſe but this, that <hi>they ioyned hand and head together in power and counſell againſt the Lord and his Chriſt.</hi> Where by the name of the Lord, you muſt vnderſtand the Almightie, euen the firſt perſon in the Trinitie, God the Father: and by the name of <hi>his Christ,</hi> firſt <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom God did annoint king of Iſrael. Then ſecondly, Ieſus, the ſonne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom the ſame God did annoint king ouer his Church. For againſt both of them was this conſpiracie made. The word in the Hebrew tongue, called <hi>Meſhihho</hi> coming of <hi>Maſhahh</hi> to annoint; and the word in the Greeke tongue, called <hi>tou Chriſtou autou,</hi> coming of <hi>chriô,</hi> to annoint, do ſignifie <hi>his Annointed.</hi> And ſeeing that both
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173667:37"/>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ieſus</hi> were annointed by God the Father, either of them may be noted out by this word; and be called <hi>His Annointed,</hi> or <hi>his Chriſt,</hi> which is all one. For annointed or Chriſt is all one in ſence, though not in ſound of words in our Engliſh tongue.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee in few words the meaning of the place, how that the great ſtates or chiefe men of the world bid band themſelues wholy againſt <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom the Lord had choſen to be the King of Iſrael, and againſt our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, whom he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be the gouernour of his Church, and the only ruler thereof. But yet before we come to ſee the veritie of this matter (which is to be touched in the next place) a queſtion here may be moued, and a man may aske, how theſe men did ioyne hand and head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Lord himſelfe? For can any (like the Giants) make warre againſt the Almightie? Yes. Many haue done it, and do daily ſtill do it. For all thoſe are ſayd to warre againſt the Lord himſelfe, who do oppoſe themſelues againſt his will and pleaſure, and withſtand ſuch matters as do tend to his glorie, and the good of his Saints; but chiefly thoſe, that do reſiſt the higher powers, and rebell againſt ſuch as the Almightie hath ſet ouer them, to be their rulers and gouernors, either in the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. As we may ſe by the words of the Lord to <hi>Samuel,</hi> when Iſrael would haue a king, in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. where the Lord doth ſay vnto him, <hi>Heare the voyce of the people in all that they ſhall ſay vnto thee: for they haue not caſt thee away, but they haue caſt me away, that I ſhould not reigne ouer them.</hi> As we may ſee by the words of our Sauiour to his Apoſtles in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. when he ſaith vnto them, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that hath ſent me.</hi> As laſtly we may ſee by <hi>Pauls</hi> words to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. when he ſaith, <hi>Whoſoeuer therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt, ſhall receiue to themſelues iudgement.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that they did reſiſt <hi>Dauid</hi> and Chriſt, whom the Lord had ſet vp, it is apparant, that they did reſiſt the Lord himſelfe. Oh that all traytors and rebels did well conſider of this point, and lay it neare vnto their ſoules. For our owne parts let vs looke vnto it: alwayes remembring what the Lord doth ſay, <hi>Touch not mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and do my Prophets no harme.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:173667:38"/>
            <p> But to paſſe this matter, and to come to the truth of the ſtory, that we may ſee how true euery thing is which is here reported; and not to ſtand vpon <hi>Dauid</hi> the figure, (whoſe ſtorie you may reade at large in the firſt booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> where you ſhall finde both Kings and Princes, as well domeſticall as forreine, banding and aſſembling themſelues againſt him,) it is apparant by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of all the Euangeliſts, that as the whole body and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Iſrael were ſet againſt our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; ſo were the States of the land, and the chiefe men of place therein, moſt deadly foes and enimies vnto him. As they banded themſelues together, to make their faction and ſide ſtrong againſt him: ſo they had their often aſſemblies, and meetings for counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, which way to bring him vnto his death. <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> (two kings as it were amongſt them) though they did iarre and diſagree betwixt themſelues; yet now they could ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt Chriſt, and become friends: as we may ſee in <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.12. in theſe words: <hi>And the ſame day</hi> Pilate <hi>and</hi> Herod <hi>were made friends together, for before they were enimies one vnto the other.</hi> Here is the banding of the Kings of the earth together, when theſe two agree in one (like good friends) who were before at ods, and do aſſemble together at Ieruſalem againſt our ſweet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour the Lords Annointed. For now at this time both of them were at Ieruſalem, and ſo as well together in place, as in heart, as it is in the 7 verſe of the ſame chapter of <hi>Luke.</hi> But for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting together, and the meeting of their Princes in aſſemblies for counſell and aduice againſt him, there are many places in the Euangeliſts declaring the ſame, but I will touch onely two at this time. The one of them is in <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 11 chapter, and 47 verſe, with ſome others following. For there we find, that after Chriſt had raiſed vp <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, the high Prieſts and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees (who were the chiefe rulers of the people, and as Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them) gathered a Councell, and aſſembled as it were in a Parliament againſt him, plodding and deuiſing what were beſt to do vnto him; and, as it is in verſe 53 of the ſame chapter, from that day forth conſulting together, to put him to death. The other of them is in <hi>Math.</hi> 26.30. where we reade, that the chiefe Prieſts, and the Scribes, and the Elders of the people, aſſembled together
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173667:38"/>into the hall of the high Prieſt, called <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and conſulted how they might take him by ſubtiltie and kill him. In regard of all which things now ſhortly touched, you ſee that this is moſt true, which is here recorded, namely, that <hi>the Kings of the earth banded themſelues, and the Princes are aſſembled together againſt the Lord, and his Annointed.</hi> The which thing the faithfull (that liued after Chriſt was aſcended into heauen, and were eye-witneſſes of thoſe things which were done vnto him) do in their prayer to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe, ſaying: <hi>For doubtleſſe againſt thine holy Sonne Ieſus, whom thou haſt annointed, both</hi> Herod <hi>&amp;</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>with the Gentles and the people of Iſrael, gathered themſelues together, to do whatſoeuer thine hand and thy counſell had determined before to be done.</hi> Acts 4.27.28.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus ſhewed the meaning of the text, and confirmed the truth thereof, let vs now come to the vſe and benefit, which we may make of the ſame. Out of it we may gather two principall doctrines. One from the perſons rebelling: the other from the manner of their rebellion. Out of the perſons rebelling we col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this doctrine, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label> That great States &amp; mighty men of this world, are oftentimes enimies vnto the truth, and deadly foes vnto holy and vpright courſes. This the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> doth ſhew, when he doth call the Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the Princes of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Eſay</hi> 1.10. for <hi>Sodome</hi> was a city ſo wicked, and the Princes thereof ſo leude and filthie, that God could not ſpare them, but for their abhominations he brought downe fire and brimſtone from heauen, and conſumed them all, as we find in the 19 chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> This <hi>Ieremie</hi> doth ſhew, when he ſaith, <hi>I will get me to the great men, and will ſpeake vnto them; for they haue knowne the way of the Lord, and the iudgement of their God: but theſe haue altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.</hi> Ier. 5.5. This <hi>Hoſea</hi> doth ſhew, when he ſaith, <hi>They are all hot as an ouen, and haue deuoured their Iudges, all their kings are fallen; there is none among them that calleth vnto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Hoſ. 7.7. This <hi>Amaziah</hi> (though a wicked man) doth ſhew, when he ſaid to <hi>Amos</hi> the Lords Prophet: <hi>O thou Seer, go flye thou away into the land of Iudah, and there eate thy bread, and propheſie there, but propheſie no more at Bethel; for it is the kings Chappell, and it is the kings Court.</hi> Amos 7.11.12. This the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:173667:39"/>ſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles doth ſhew, when they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, caſt into priſon, beaten, and put to death by <hi>Herod,</hi> by the high Prieſts, and other officers and ſtates men for gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as we may ſee in the 4.5.12. and other chapters of the ſame booke. This the complaint of the Church doth ſhew, when ſhe doth ſay, <hi>The watchmen that went about the citie found me, they ſmote me and wounded me, the watchmen of the wals tooke away my veile from me.</hi> Cant. 5.7. for by watchmen here are meant the chiefe rulers of the Church, who ſhould watch ouer her for her good, and not thus perſecute her and wound her, as they did. This the ſtorie of the ten perſecutions doth ſhew, when <hi>Nero, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian, Traian, Antonie, Seuerus, Maximinus, Decius, Valerian, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> moſt bloudy Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> did make hauocke of the Church of God, and perſecute to the death ſuch as did call vpon his holy name. This, laſtly, the example of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges doth ſhew, and daily experience with men of our time, when we with our owne eyes do ſee, and with our owne eares do heare, what bloudy things are decreed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in other places, againſt true Proteſtants, and the ſincere ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the Lord, euen by them that are in the higheſt roomes, and do beare the chiefeſt ſway amongſt men in thoſe dominions.</p>
            <p>But how may this come to paſſe,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
               </label> may ſome man ſay, that the higheſt perſons, and the chiefeſt for wealth and authoritie, do thus oppoſe themſelues againſt the Lord and his moſt holy and bleſſed wayes? For of all men in the word they are moſt behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto God, and haue greater cauſes (as one ſhould iudge) to loue him, and to worſhip him, then the meaner and poorer people haue. For firſt, they are daintily educated, and with great charges brought vp in all good literature and learning. Secondly, they haue abundance of riches and worldly wealth to ſupply their wants at all times. Thirdly, they haue great honor and reputation amongſt the ſonnes of men in all places, for gouernment and the matters of this world. Laſtly, they excell all others (for the moſt part) in their perſons both for wit, and other naturall qualities of the mind, and alſo for pulchritude, and other goodly properties of the body. Surely for all theſe cauſes; and many more, they are much bound vnto the Almightie; and in regard of them, it is their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:173667:39"/>part and duty, <hi>to ſerue him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of their liues,</hi> they being euermore ſeruent in the ſpirit, and moſt zealous of all good workes. For the more kind and bountifull that any is vnto vs, the more louing and obedient ſhould we be againe vnto him. But through their corruptions, it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with them. For theſe things make them the worſe, and not the better, and (like a violent floud) they carrie them to all kind of abhominations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe they make them proud and arrogant in their hearts; for pride is the roote of all euill: as it caſt the Angels out of heauen, <hi>Adam</hi> out of paradiſe, <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; ſo it doth ſtill deceiue men and make them rebell againſt the Almightie. <hi>The wicked man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid) is ſo proud, that he ſeeketh not for God, he thinketh alwayes, there is no God.</hi> Pſal. 10.4. And the Lord ſaith to <hi>Edom</hi> (who was a bitter enimie to him and his people) <hi>The pride of thine heart hath deceiued thee, thou that dwelleſt in the clefts of the rockes, whoſe habitation is high, that ſaith in his heart, Who ſhall bring me downe to the ground?</hi> Obadiah verſe 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe they make them riotous and licentious in their liues. For intemperancy of body, and abundance of fleſhly pleaſures, do cauſe them to forget the Lord, and to ſpurne againſt him, that made them. But <hi>he</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that ſhould haue bene vpright, when he waxed fat, ſpurned with his heele: thou art fat</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to Iſrael) <hi>thou art groſſe, thou art laden with fatneſſe: therefore he forſooke God, that made him, and regarded not the ſtrong God of his ſaluation.</hi> Deut. 32.15. Againe you know, it is ſaid of the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man in the parable that though others made their excuſes for not coming vnto the feaſt, whereunto they were bidden, yet he made none, but ſaid peremptorily, <hi>I haue maried a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</hi> Luk. 14.20. declaring there by that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this life are moſt forcible meanes to withdraw vs from the Lord, and from all ſuch duries as do belong vnto him; as alſo from our owne eternall happineſſe, which is in the heauens aboue.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe they make them moſt ſtiffe and obſtinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt holy, and powerfull miniſtery of the word. For the contempt of the word is the very leproſie of the ſoule, and the killing plague of the body. <hi>Wherewith</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid) ſhall a young
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173667:40"/>man redreſſe his way? In taking heed thereto according to thy word.</hi> Pſal. 119.9. And <hi>the wiſe men</hi> (as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith) <hi>are aſhamed, they are afraid, and taken. Loe, they haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what wiſedome is in them?</hi> Ier. 8.9. So that without the word, there is no goodneſſe in men. Yet they ſay, when faithfull meſſengers come to them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> came vnto <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord, that I ſhould heare his voyce, and let Iſrael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael go.</hi> Exod. 5.2. What (ſay they) ſhall theſe command vs? and ſhall we do according to their ſayings? No, no, but downe with them, downe with them, let them not liue, but die: or, as it is in <hi>Ieremy chap.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Come, and let vs imagine ſome deuice againſt them; for the law ſhall not periſh from the Prieſt, nor counſell from the wiſe, nor the word from the Prophet: come, and let vs ſmite them with the tongue, and let vs not giue heed to any of their words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe they make them to proſper, and to carry out all matters for this world, according to their owne hearts deſire. For proſperitie and good ſucceſſe in our wayes doth harden mans heart exceedingly againſt the Lord, and all holy proceedings. <hi>His wayes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſpeaking of the wicked vnto God) <hi>alway proſper, thy iudgements are high ouer his ſight, therefore defieth he all his enimies,</hi> Pſal. 10.5. And we find in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14.15. that many did refuſe to ſerue the Lord, and to keepe his commandements, and choſe rather to be lewd and wicked; becauſe (as they ſaid) <hi>the proud were bleſſed, and they which wrought wickedneſſe were ſet vp, and ſuch as tempted God were deliuered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, becauſe they make them to haue a falſe opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as if they were in good caſe, and were in the high fauour of God, when it is nothing ſo. For this falſe perſwaſion of theirs doth rocke them faſt aſleepe in their ſinnes, &amp; ſo bind the cords of their iniquity, that they can hardly euer be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe. Surely as they ſay in their harts, they ſhal neuer be moued, nor be in danger, as it is in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 10.6. or as it is in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 49.11. <hi>They thinke their houſes, and their habitations ſhall continue for euer, euen from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and call their lands by their names:</hi> So this doth cauſe them not to returne vnto the Lord, but to go on ſtil in their ſinnes againſt him, as we may ſee in <hi>Ieremy, chap.</hi> 5.12. in theſe words: <hi>They haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Lord, and ſaid, It is not he, neither ſhall the plague come vpon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173667:40"/>vs, neither ſhall we ſee ſword or famine,</hi> and as it may alſo be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of <hi>Chapter</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. where the Lord ſaith vnto Iſrael, who thought themſelues deare vnto the Almightie, and free from all plagues in that reſpect, <hi>Trust not in lying words, ſaying: The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, this is the temple of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe they make them to be attended vpon by many flatterers, who will ſmooth them on in their ſinnes; and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſuch, as will giue vnto them wicked counſell, as the young men did vnto <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> when he cauſed ten tribes to reuolt from him. For flattery and euill counſell are the bane of all good manners, and forcible ſpurres to driue men forward to all wickedneſſe. For, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſay, <hi>Euill words corrupt good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> 1. Cor. 15.33. ſo the Lord doth teſtifie, that <hi>flattering teachers, and euill counſellors, do ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not returne from their wickedneſſe,</hi> in ſer. 23.14.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue ſixe reaſons in particular of their rebellion and conſpiracie; The firſt is the pride of their hearts, who are puft vp with their eſtate, and ſwolne (like a blowne bladder) with the vaine wind of their outward pompe. The ſecond, is the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie of their liues, who liue in all kind of exceſſe for diet, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and other worldly pleaſures moſt ſweete and delightfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fleſh. The third, is the contempt of the word, who medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate but ſeldome vpon the law of God, and come but now and then to the place, where it is ſoundly and vnpartially diuided. The fourth, is the proſperity of their wayes, who flouriſh like the Bay tree, and are not in trouble as other men, or plagued as they be, but do liue at eaſe, are ſtrong and luſtie, and haue more then heart can wiſh. The fift, is the falſe perſwaſion which they haue of themſelues, who thinke that they ſhall continue ſtill in their flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing eſtate, and neuer ſee any woe or miſery. The ſixt and laſt, is the flattering and wicked counſell which they receiue from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who gladly accept of that which is ſpoken in their praiſe, or agrees well with the vile inclination of their hearts. But the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon of all, is the corruption of their ſoules, and the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of their crooked nature, who turne that into poyſon vnto themſelues, like the ſpider, which they ſhould conuert into hony with the Bee.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:173667:41"/>
            <p> But to leaue the reaſons,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> and to come to the vſes; here we may learne many things, but chiefly foure. The firſt is, that we muſt not depend vpon great men, or the higher powers of the world for their countenance; as we learned in the firſt verſe, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the multitude for their number. For here we ſee, that they are againſt the Lord, and his Annointed. And therefore if we hang vpon them, &amp; do as they do, iniquity will be our ouerthrow, and hell fire will be our portion at the laſt, when we ſhall dearly repent for it, but all too late. Some there are of them (I grant) who are moſt godly and vpright perſons, walking ſincerely in the paths of the Almightie; but they are exceeding few, here one, and there another: but for the greateſt part of them, they are naught and wicked, as we may ſee by the Apoſtles words in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. when he ſaith: <hi>For brethren you ſee your calling, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mightie, not many noble are called.</hi> And therefore, I beſeech you brethren, looke well to this point, conforme not your ſelues to the religion of great States, nor walk after the maners of the wealthy men of the world; but be you followers alone of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; become holy, as God your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is holy, in all maner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation; &amp; ſo you ſhal not be figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt the Almightie, as theſe Giants are, but be faithfull and obedient vnto him to your owne good, &amp; euerlaſting happineſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this, that if we will ioyne with the Lord, &amp; take part with him, we muſt looke for great enimies to ariſe vp againſt vs, as well as ſmall ones. <hi>Ye ſhall be brought</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt vnto his Diſciples, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.18.) <hi>to the gouernours and kings for myſake, in witneſſe to them and to the Gentles.</hi> So muſt we looke to be brought before ſuch; and when ſuch matters do fall out, we muſt not be diſcouraged, as though ſome new thing had happened vnto vs: but be well contented therewith, knowing that it hath bene ſo from the beginning, and ſhall be ſo ſtill to the end of the world. As <hi>Ahab</hi> was ſet againſt <hi>Eliah, Saul</hi> againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Haman</hi> againſt <hi>Mordecay,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Babel</hi> againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Herod</hi> againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, the high Prieſts and Elders of the people againſt the Apoſtles, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his Princes of Aegypt againſt Iſrael: ſo muſt Gods children thinke, that ſome great States, and mightie men of this world, will ſet themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:173667:41"/>them at all times, and that they ſhall neuer be free from their oppoſitions, but ſhall ſtill be moleſted by them to the ende. Oh thinke vpon this well, and make a good vſe of it for your ſelues. For <hi>praemoniti, praemuniti,</hi> fore-warned, fore-armed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſts words in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Theſe things haue I ſayd vnto you, that ye ſhould not be offended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, that euery one of vs, who are more wealthy then others, and haue greater places of dignitie then they haue, ſhould looke moſt warily to our ſelues, that our wealth and places do nor ſteale away our hearts from God, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> words in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> For you ſee, we ſtand in a ſlipperie place: and if others do fall round about vs, as we ſee and heare they do, pray we heartily to the Lord, that he would keepe vs; and let vs watch and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, alwayes walking faithfully in our callings, and humbling our ſelues to the very duſt before the Lord our maker. Remember we ſtil, what <hi>Paul</hi> doth write vnto <hi>Timothy</hi> in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.18.19. and let vs follow the ſame. <hi>Charge them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, and that they truſt not in vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riches, but in the liuing God, (which giueth vs abundantly all things to enioy;) that they do good, and be rich in good workes, and ready to distribute and communicate, laying vp in ſtore for themſelues a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may obtaine eternall life.</hi> If men trauell in thoſe places where others before them haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhipwracke, or do fight with thoſe enimies, who haue alwaies conquered others, they are very fearefull, and circumſpect, leſt they ſhould miſcarry. So ſhould it be with vs in this caſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſee others led away captiues to ſinne by their outward pompe and ſtate, and do behold but a few rich men truly fearing the Lord, we ſhould vpon the due conſideration thereof walke wiſely and circumſpectly, redeeming the time, and working out our ſaluation with feare and trembling.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt is, that we ſhould both pray and reioyce in the behalfe of our gouernours, and the higheſt powers of our land. For ſeeing all generally do fall, and become enimies to the Lord, that are in thoſe places of eminency farre aboue others; and yet they do ſtand, and are faithfull embracers of the truth: we haue
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:173667:42"/>great cauſe to bleſſe the name of our God for it, and to pray vnto him for a continuance of the ſame; that ſo they may neuer ſhrinke backe, but grow better and better, vntill they come to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all goodneſſe in the heauens aboue, and there enioy all thoſe beatitudes, which are prouided for them in that celeſtiall place. Doubtleſſe there is no nation in the world ſo much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto God in this reſpect, as we of <hi>England</hi> are. As once we did ſay, We haue an excellent Queene, ſo we may now ſay, We haue an excellent King. His eſtate is moſt dangerous, yet (bleſſed be our God) he doth ſtand and maintaine the truth of the Goſpel, as he ought to do. He is like a goodly blazing torch ſet vpon the top of a mountaine, which there doth giue light, and not go out, do all the winds of the heauen againſt it what they can. Strange would the ſpectacle be, if ſuch a matter were viſible to our eye. I doubt not, but all of vs would ſtand wondering, if we ſhould ſee a candle burning on the top of our houſes in a windy and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous night, and yet neuer go out, before it be burnt to the very end of it. So may we wonder at his ſtanding, and at the Lords mercy in vpholding him, he is ſo aſſaulted on euery ſide, and ſet vpon by the contrary blaſts of ſundrie oppoſitions. I pray you, let vs alwayes pray vnto the Lord for him, and beſeech him moſt earneſtly vpon the knees of our ſoules, that he would alwayes keepe him in his feare, that he may neuer fall, but abide euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in his holy integritie amongſt vs: but beware we, that we neuer forget our dutie vnto him, but remaine alwayes faithfull and louing vnto him vnto the end. And ſo I paſſe from this firſt doctrine, and come vnto the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Out of the manner of their rebellion and conſpiracie, in that they did band themſelues, and ſit in Councell againſt the Lord and his Annointed,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label> we collect this doctrine, that there are Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Parliaments held as well againſt the Lord, as for the Lord, and cleane contrary vnto his truth, as for his truth. This we may ſee by thoſe Councels, which were held in the time of the old Teſtament; as firſt in the dayes of <hi>Omri,</hi> when cruell and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſtatutes were made againſt the Lord and his people, as may be gathered out of <hi>Micha, chap.</hi> 6.16. Secondly, in the dayes of <hi>Ahab,</hi> when all the men of Izreel, euen the Elders and gouernors
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:173667:42"/>thereof, the Nobles and others did aſſemble together, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce death againſt innocent <hi>Naboth</hi> for his vineyards ſake, which he had before denied vnto the king. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.8. <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Thirdly, in the dayes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> when he tooke counſell, and made two calues of gold for diuine worſhip, the one whereof he ſet in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the other in <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. <hi>King</hi> 12.28.29. Laſtly, in the dayes of <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> (to paſſe ouer others) when a golden image was ſet vp in the plaine of <hi>Dura,</hi> in the prouince of <hi>Babel,</hi> for all men to worſhip, vnder paine of extreme puniſhment, euen to be caſt into the midſt of an hot firie furnace. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This you may ſee by thoſe Councels which were held in the time of the new Teſtament in the dayes of our Sauiour and his Apoſtles. For in them, the Iewes did not onely excommunicate all thoſe that did confeſſe Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.22. and forbid the Apoſtles to preach any more in his name, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.18. but they did alſo in their ſolemne Councels condemne him to death. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.66. and ſo cauſed the Lord of glorie to be crucified. Laſtly, this you may ſee by thoſe Councels which were held ſince that time vntill our dayes, as by the Councell which was held at <hi>Antioch,</hi> when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was condemned, and the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie approued: by the Councell held at <hi>Epheſus</hi> when <hi>Eutyches</hi> hereſie was allowed: by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell held at <hi>Neocaſarea,</hi> when ſecond mariage was forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: by the Councell held at <hi>Nice,</hi> when it was concluded, that in holy Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the images of Saints ſhould be worſhipped: by the Councell at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> when they were excommunicated that did receiue the Sacrament in both kinds: and (to let go others) by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell held at <hi>London,</hi> when in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> open ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry was commanded and eſtabliſhed by law.</p>
            <p>Well then, you ſee this is a matter moſt cleare and euident, that aſſemblies and Councels are as well againſt the Lord, as for the Lord. But what may the reaſons thereof be, will you ſay? They are in number theſe two. The one is,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
               </label> becauſe the wicked and vngodly haue their aſſemblies and councels, as well as the godly and holy ones, as all Chronicles do manifeſt vnto vs. For as no man doth gather grapes of thornes, or figges of thiſtles: ſo no good thing can proceed from them, but onely that which is naught and wicked, being enmitie to the Lord, and all holy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:173667:43"/>wayes, according to the qualitie of their crooked and peruerſe nature, from whence it doth proceed. The other is, becauſe the godly themſelues, who haue alſo their Councels and Aſſemblies, are not perfectly holy, but many imperfections do ſtill remaine in them, while they are here in this world; according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the whole Scripture, and that ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>&amp;c. For we know in part, and we propheſie in part,</hi> and ſo forth. For they failing through theſe their imperfections, ſometimes in iudgement, for want of a diſcerning and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſpirit; and ſometimes in affection, through the predominant paſſions of the ſoule, which are not yet rectified according to the word; it muſt needs be, that now and then they erre and miſſe, and eſtabliſh ſuch matters as haue no ſanctitie or holineſſe inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in them. For this is a moſt ſure ground both in diuinitie, and in philoſophie, that as the cauſe is, ſuch is the effect; and therefore ſeeing the cauſe here is bad, the effect cannot be good, but be bad alſo.</p>
            <p>It is good for vs to thinke on this point,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
               </label> and to faſten this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine deeply in our ſoules, which now we haue handled. For it will be ſeruiceable vnto vs many wayes. For out of it, firſt we may learne, contrary to the doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Councels may erre and be deceiued. They hold, they cannot; and for this wicked aſſertion of theirs, they abuſe certaine places of holy Scripture, as that in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. <hi>It ſeemed good to vs and the holy Ghoſt;</hi> that in <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. <hi>I am with you to the end of the world;</hi> and that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me.</hi> So then thus they argue. Councels are neuer without the Spirit of God, therefore can they not erre. A ſilly argument, as though the Spirit of God were at their commandement, or were tied to places and perſons; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent did leade men into all truth, as it did the Apoſtles, whoſe preachings and decrees are now, and were then, the rules of our faith and manners. Tuſh, Councels are now and then without the Spirit of God, as conſiſting either onely of wicked perſons, or of a mixt number, both good and bad, whereof the greater part is the worſe; as theirs alſo ſeemed to be at <hi>Rome</hi> vnder <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23, when there appeared a great Owle, which ſtared and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the Pope; who bluſhed at the matter, and fuming roſe vp,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:173667:43"/>and departed; and when others whiſpered one in anothers eare, ſaying. That the ſpirit appeared in the likeneſſe of an Owle. And as Councels are without the Spirit ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo when they naue it, they haue it not in fulneſſe or perfection, as we touched before, and therfore doth not keepe them from all error or miſtaking, but they may erre notwithſtanding the preſence of the Spirit, which is within them. Let this ſuffice for the confutation of the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place we may here learne, that ſeeing there are Councels and Parliaments held as well againſt the Lord as for the Lord, that we muſt not raſhly approue of all things, which are eſtabliſhed &amp; decreed by Councels and Parliaments, but we muſt firſt examine them, whether they be agreeable to the word of God or no. <hi>Try all things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.) <hi>and hold faſt that which is good.</hi> The like counſell <hi>Iohn</hi> doth giue vs, ſaying: <hi>Beleeue not euery ſpirit, but try the ſpirits, whether they are of God, for many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> 1. Ioh. 4.1. And thus the <hi>Beroeans</hi> did; for when <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas</hi> came, &amp; preached amongſt them, they receiued the word with all readineſſe, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo or no, as they taught them. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. So alſo did the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> For when ſome came vnto them, and ſayd that they were Apoſtles, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were not, they examined them, and found them liers. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.2. And ſo laſtly muſt we our ſelues do; for we muſt not build our faith vpon men, who may deceiue vs, but vpon the word of God, which cannot deceiue vs. Any thing that is agreeable to the ſame, we muſt receiue; and whatſoeuer is contrary vnto it we muſt reiect and caſt away, ſaying with the Apoſtles, <hi>We ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obey God then man.</hi> Acts 5.29.</p>
            <p>In the third and laſt place, from this, that Councels and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are as well againſt the Lord, as for the Lord, we may learne: that we muſt not be too raſh either in iudgement or in ſpeech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the gouernors of our land, for that they do condemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles, and all other vnlawfull aſſemblies. It is a thing to be wiſhed, that all meetings were for God, and the aduancement of his glorie: and it would be a thing very profitable, if Chriſtians did come together (chiefly the Miniſters of the word) for holy conference in good matters, that they might helpe one the other
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173667:44"/>by their mutuall ſaith, and other bleſſed gifts, wherewith they do abound in great abundance. But yet ſeeing many inconueruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces oftentimes do come by Aſſemblies, and that there are mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as well againſt the Lord, as for the Lord; by traytors, by Papiſts, by Anabaptiſts, by theeues, by other malefactors, who are enimtes both to God, and the good eſtate of our land: let vs not be diſcontented ouer-much, though our meetings be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſtrained by law, neither let vs repine in our hearts againſt our gouernours for the ſame: but let vs know that they had ſome good reaſon for that which they haue done, and that we our ſelues (who are faithfull to God, and loyall to our King) may take libertie enough in the feare of God, <hi>to prouoke to loue and to good workes,</hi> and to be mutuall helpes one vnto the other in all duties of true Chriſtianity, if we will our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Their words do now follow to be handled, wherein conſider firſt how they do ſtirre vp and prouoke one the other to their naughtineſſe; then the thing it ſelfe, which they would do, and gladly bring to paſſe, as being the very iſſue of their whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and conſultation, and the maine point wherein their rebellion and treaſon ſtood. In the handling of theſe I will be ſuccinct and ſhort, but chiefly in the firſt. For that I will but onely touch, and away. It is expreſſed in this word, <hi>Come, come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>let vs breake their bands, and caſt their cords behind vs.</hi> In which we ſee the guiſe and propertie of the world; the wicked haue a <hi>Come</hi> as well as the godly, but farre differing from theirs. For the godly haue their <hi>Come,</hi> as a word of encouragement to religion and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes thereof; as when they ſay: <hi>O come, and let vs ſing vnto the Lord, let vs heartily reioyce in the ſtrength of his ſaluation:</hi> or as it is in <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.3. <hi>Come, and let vs go vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of</hi> Iacob, <hi>and he will teach vs his wayes, and we will walke in his pathes. For the law ſhall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Ieruſalem.</hi> But the wickeds <hi>Come,</hi> is to conſpiracie and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as here we may ſee: in which they are more diligent, then the children of light are in their good: for their bodies meete, their heads meete, their hearts meete, and both outward and inward they are earneſt in euill, the encourage one the other therein as much as may be, and they haue their <hi>come</hi> alwayes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:173667:44"/>for all their plots. Such a <hi>come</hi> we reade of againſt bleſſed <hi>Ieremie: Come</hi> (ſaid the wicked) <hi>and let vs. imagine a deuice against</hi> Ieremy, <hi>let vs ſmite him with the tongue, and not giue credit to any of his words.</hi> Ier. 18.18. Such another haue ruffians, and theeues, and ſwaggering fellowes in the booke of the Prouerbs: <hi>Come, and caſt in thy lot with ours, for we will haue all but one purſe, &amp;c.</hi> Prou. 1.11. &amp;c. Such another hath the harlot to the young man: <hi>Come, let vs take our fill of loue vntill the morning, let vs take our pleaſure in dalliance; for mine husband is not at home, he is gone aiourney farre off, &amp;c.</hi> Prou. 7.18. &amp;c. But to ſuch curſed <hi>comes</hi> let vs neuer hearken, according to the good counſell which <hi>Wiſedome</hi> doth giue vs in the <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> and namely in the firſt chapter, &amp; 15 verſe thereof, ſaying, <hi>My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them, refraine thy foote from their path:</hi> and let vs euer remember what the Pſalme ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man, that doth not walke in the counſell of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, nor ſtand in the way of ſinners, nor ſit in the ſeate of the ſcornefull; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</hi> Pſal. 1.1.2. And ſo I paſſe from this point of their wicked and diuelliſh exhortation, and come to the thing it ſelfe, whereunto it is bent; onely intreating you by the way, that you would learne by their example to be more zealous and earneſt in your holy religion then now you are. For ſhall they exhort one the other, and whet on each man his brother to wicked abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and to dreadfull rebellion and treaſon? and ſhall not we much more prouoke one the other to loue, and to all good works, that we may be faithfull ſeruants vnto God, and loyall ſubiects vnto our King? Yes, yes, beloued, it is our duty ſo to do; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe theſe perſons may riſe vp in iudgement hereafter againſt vs. Wherefore let vs ſtirre vp one the other to goodneſſe, and to all holy duties whatſoeuer, ſaying: Come, let vs <hi>honour all men, loue brotherly fellowſhip; feare God, honour the King,</hi> and doe in all points, as it doth become vs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance and matter of their exhortation, if you marke the text, is to caſt off all obedience to the iuſt and holy lawes of the Lord and his Annointed. For their words are theſe: <hi>Let vs breake their bands, and cast their cords behind vs.</hi> A diuelliſh concluſion, and a wicked reſolution, you ſee it is. What! could they in all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173667:45"/>their conſultations find no better matter then this, to agree vpon? was this the only iſſue of all their labours? Alas, alas, wee ſee what man is: he is a very beaſt by his owne knowledge, as it is in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 10.14. and as <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſhew, he is an enimy vnto God his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. But let vs examine this point a little. As all good rulers haue their lawes and ſtatutes, for the better gouernment of their people; ſo God hath his lawes and his ſtatutes, which he doth giue vnto his people for them to obſerue and keepe, that ſo they might not liue according to their owne phanſies and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but according to his will and pleaſure, they euermore auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe things which he hath condemned, and performing thoſe things which he hath commanded.</p>
            <p>But behold here, theſe men ſcorne thoſe lawes and ſtatutes, and refuſe altogether to be obedient vnto them. They would caſt them off for euer, and breake them all to peeces, if they could. And becauſe they would make all things odious in reſpect of the Lord &amp; his Annointed (whether <hi>Dauid</hi> or Chriſt,) and very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and colourable in regard of themſelues, they forge a very groſſe and palpable compariſon; for they do compare themſelues, as it were, to certaine beaſts and vnreaſonable creatures; and theſe lawes and ſtatutes of the Lord publiſhed by <hi>Dauid</hi> and Chriſt, vnto certaine bands and cords; inſinuating thereby, that they are no better vſed, then the very beaſts of the field, or other vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures, that muſt be tied faſt with bands and cords, for feare of hurting people, or wandring abroad, whither they ſhould not. For as theſe beaſts are bridled and reſtrained by their bonds and cords, ſo were they by theſe lawes and ſtatutes, ſo that they could not do what they would do. In regard whereof they go now about to be looſed from this bondage and ſubiection, which was in their opinion altogether intollerable, and not to be borne or ſuffered any longer. Wherefore their meaning in theſe words, when they ſay, <hi>Let vs breake their bands, and caſt their cords behind vs,</hi> is nothing elſe but this, Let vs obſerue and keepe their lawes and ſtatutes no more, nor be any longer ſubiect and obedient vnto them or their authoritie.</p>
            <p>Out of this we may collect two doctrines,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> the one is, that mans nature is againſt the law of God, and vnwilling to be ſubiect or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:173667:45"/>obedient thereunto, according to the example of theſe men. The other is, that when men do reſiſt the law of God, &amp; oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the ſame, then do they rebell againſt God himſelfe, and become traytors vnto him, as theſe were; for this is noted as the maine point, wherein their treaſon ſtood, in that they did thus reiect the lawes and ſtatutes of the Almightie, and withſtand the ſame to the vttermoſt that they could. On theſe two, let vs ſtand a little.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that mans nature is againſt the law of God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be ſubiect or obedient thereunto. The whole ſtory of the Bible doth ſhew this, but one place at this time ſhall be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for all, as containing many ages vnder it, and that is in <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> 7.23. &amp;c. when the Lord ſaith by his ſeruant there: But this thing commanded I them, ſaying: <hi>Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people; and walke yee in all the wayes which I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded you, that it may be well vnto you.</hi> But they would not obey nor incline their eare, but went after the counſels and the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnneſſe of their wicked heart, and went backward, and not forward. Since the day that your fathers came vp out of the land of Aegypt, vnto this day, I haue euen ſent vnto you all my ſeruants and Prophets, riſing vp early euery day, and ſending them; yet would they not heare me, nor incline their eare, but hardned the necke, and did worſe then their fathers. As thus Iſrael dealt, ſo deale all men at all times, we find it ſo ſtill by daily experience, as well as by andient records. So that a good man may cry out, and ſay, as it is in the ſame propheſie of <hi>Ieremy, Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>Vnto whom ſhall I ſpeake, and admoniſh, that they may heare? behold their eares are vncircumciſed, and they cannot hearken; behold, the word of the Lord is vnto them as a reproch, they haue no delight in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is the reaſon of this? as God ſaid to Iſrael, <hi>What ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie haue your fathers found in me, that they are gone farre from me, and haue walked after vanitie, and are become vaine?</hi> Ieremie 2.5. ſo may we ſay to theſe men; What iniquity haue they found in the lawes and ſtatutes of the Lord, that they do ſo ſpurne at them? or what euill is lurking in them, that they do ſo reiect them? What? are they not iuſt and vpright? Yes, as we may ſee by <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.8. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith: <hi>And what nation is ſo great, that hath ordinances
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:173667:46"/>and lawes ſo righteous, as all this law, which I ſet before you this day?</hi> What! are they not good and profitable? Yes, as we may ſee by ſundry places of diuine Writ, &amp; namely by the teſtimony of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. when he ſaith, that <hi>in keeping of them there is great reward.</hi> What! are they not, laſtly, eaſie and pleaſant? Yes, as we may ſee by Chriſts owne words in <hi>Math.</hi> 11.30. when he ſaith, <hi>For my yoke is eaſie, and my burden light:</hi> and by the ſaying of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who reports them to be ſweeter vnto him then the hony, or the hony combe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. How chance then are they reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? and for what cauſe are they ſo caſt off? The cauſes thereof are theſe. Firſt, becauſe they are contrary to their natures, and to all the affections of their ſoules, which are wholly bent againſt them; in ſo much as Wiſedome her ſelfe is an enmitie vnto them, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach vs in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. ſaying, <hi>Becauſe the wiſedome of the fleſh is enmitie againſt God; for it is not ſubiect to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> For they cannot loue or like that, by any meanes, which doth croſſe their natures, and controll the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their hearts; that is euen death to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe they condemne their ſinnes, which are ſweet, and profitable vnto them; and threaten eternall iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for them. For they cannot endure to heare of their faults, and of Gods curſes belonging vnto them for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe they are not accuſtomed to them. For we like not of things which we neuer vſed, and they are tedious and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſome vnto vs, as a new ſtraite doublet is to a child which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wore any before; according to <hi>Dauids</hi> ſaying, when he had <hi>Sauls</hi> harneſſe on his backe: <hi>I cannot go with theſe, for I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed.</hi> 1. Sam. 17.39.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe they are vnable for to obſerue &amp; to keepe them, as wanting Chriſt to helpe them, and the ſpirit of the Lord to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them. For we grieue and murmure againſt all thoſe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire vnpoſſible things at our hands, and we abhorre the burden which we cannot carry or ſafely vndergo.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of this doctrine thus touched,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> the vſes of it are theſe. Firſt hereby we may ſee what a downfall man did receiue by <hi>Adams</hi> fall. He is not a little maimed, or hurt in ſome parts of his ſoule or body alone, but he is wholly corrupted, and made a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173667:46"/>deadly enimie vnto his maker. Some there are, that do extoll man too highly: they ſay, that he is like a boy of a ſprack wit, that wants but a good maiſter to inſtruct him; or a faire white paper, that needs nothing but a writing to be ſet in it. But here we ſee it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: for as man is ignorant of the law of God, ſo he is a ſtarke enimie vnto it; he will not be ſubiect to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, nor be obedient vnto them. Surely euery man by nature is dead in his ſinnes and treſpaſſes, as <hi>Paul</hi> did obſerue of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. and no man, vnleſſe he be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, can thinke well of the law of the Lord, and yeeld vp chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience thereunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here we may behold the great difference, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the wicked and the godly. For as the wicked do abhorre the lawes of God, ſaying: <hi>Come, let vs breake their bands, and caſt their cords behind vs;</hi> ſo the godly do loue the lawes of God, ſaying: <hi>Come, and let vs go vp to the mountaine of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of</hi> Iacob, <hi>and he will teach vs his wayes, and we will walke in his paths.</hi> Mica. 4.2. And the reaſons thereof are theſe. Firſt, becauſe they ſee they come from God their ſweet Sauiour, and do tend to their eternall good: for we cannot but loue that which doth come from him whom we loue beſt, and of whom we are loued moſt, eſpecially, when we know, that he will ſend vs nothing, which is hurtfull, but good, as we iudge of God, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne word in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. Secondly, becauſe they know, that the curſe thereof ſhall neuer take hold of them, in as much as Chriſt was made a curſe for them. Thirdly, becauſe they are made eaſie, and pleaſant vnto them, as by vſe and cuſtome (they exerciſing themſelues therein day and night,) ſo chiefly by the regeneration of the holy ſpirit of God, who doth aſſiſt them, and make them powerfull vnto good workes. Laſtly, becauſe they bring with them great rewards, and honours at the laſt, euen ioyes that are vnſpeakable, and riches without all end for number and continuance. For as this made <hi>Iacob</hi> to ſerue ſeuen yeares for <hi>Rahel,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> to leaue <hi>Pharaohs</hi> court, and to endure much trouble in the wilderneſſe, euen the reward, that they did looke for: ſo doth this excellent reward, which doth attend vpon the obſeruers of Gods commandements, make vs euermore to regard them, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:173667:47"/>to haue a care to obſerue and to keepe them. More might be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of this difference that is betwixt the godly and the wicked, but this is enough.</p>
            <p>The other doctrine (collected out of the text) is this,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that when men do reſiſt the law of God, and oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame, then do they rebell againſt God himſelfe, and become traytors vnto him. As he is a traytor to his Prince, who doth altogether ſet himſelfe againſt the lawes of his Prince, and will be ſubiect to none of them, but breake them all, to diſgrace him, and to bring an ouerthrow vnto his eſtate or kingdome. The reaſon is this (for I will but touch this point, and end) <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
               </label> becauſe his lawes are but the ſignifications of his will, and the teſtimonies of his mind and pleaſure vnto vs. And you know; that none can reſiſt his will, mind or pleaſure, but he muſt needs reſiſt him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The vſe hereof ſtandeth chiefly in two things:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> For firſt it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to detect the great ſinnes and enormities that are amongſt vs. <hi>There is a generation</hi> (ſaith <hi>Agur</hi> in <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.12.) <hi>that are pure in their owne conceipts, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſſe.</hi> We are of that number; for we thinke too well of our ſelues. Who is there almoſt that doth count himſelfe a rebell and a tray tor againſt his God? yet all of vs are ſuch; for we breake his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtill, and will not be ruled by his ſtatutes and ordinances, but we follow the imaginations of our owne hearts, and do what ſeeme good in our owne eyes. For theſe things we muſt ſtrike vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the thighs and repent, and learne to do ſo no more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſhould awaken vs vp, and be a ſharpe ſpurre in our ſides to keepe vs alwayes running in the commandements of our God. Oh beloued brethren, how carefull ſhould we be both to know the lawes of our God, and alſo to keepe them, conſidering that otherwiſe we do but rebell and commit treaſon againſt our ſweet and louing God? Shall we riſe vp againſt him that hath made vs? againſt him that hath redeemed vs? againſt him that hath ſanctified vs? againſt him that doth daily preſcrue vs? and againſt him in one word, that will glorifie vs hereafter in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens! No, no, farre be this from our ſoules; yet this we muſt needs do, vnleſſe we endeuor carefully to keepe his commandements.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:173667:47"/>And therfore, I beſeech you, looke to them; Let them be <hi>a lanterne to your feete, and a light to your paths.</hi> Let them be your counſellors, and the men of your law; and whatſoeuer you thinke, deſire, ſpeake or do, thinke all, deſire all, ſpeake all, and do all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule and direction thereof, that ſo you may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and traytors vnto the Lord, but be his ſaithfull ſeruants and true ſubiects vnto your liues ende. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto the Prophet hath ſhewed, who did rebell againſt the Lord, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. Now he doth begin to declare, what the Lord, and his Annointed are, againſt whom they do ſo rebell. The Lord is ſet out in theſe three verſes, and his Annointed in the three next. The ſcope &amp; drift in the deſcription of them both, is one and the ſelfe ſame, and it ſtands in two points. The one is to ſhew, that all the oppoſition or reſiſtance that is made againſt them is in vaine, and to no purpoſe. The other is to declare, that thoſe that do make the oppoſition, or reſiſtance, are in moſt wofull and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched caſe, and ſuch as cannot eſcape moſt fearefull and vnreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable iudgements; vnleſſe they do in time preuent the ſame, by true and hearty repentance or amendment of life, in turning vnto them, and in becoming faithfull and loyall ſubiects vnto them, as they ought to be. This is the ſumme of all theſe verſes, but at this time we are to ſtand vpon the three former alone.</p>
            <p>The Prophet going about to deſcribe the Lord, euen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the godhead, or the firſt Perſon in the Trinitie, notes him out firſt of all by his place or abode; which is not vpon the earth, where his enimies may come at him, but in the heauens, where they cannot come neare vnto him, ſo that all their power, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:173667:48"/>malice intended againſt him can do him no harme. The which thing the Almighty doth ſee full well; for he is not afraid of them, but as a man that is careleſſe of his enimie, whom he knowes cannot hurt him, doth nothing but laugh and deride at him, ſo doth he laugh and deride at them: he hath them in deriſion, and ſo ſhall haue them ſtill in deriſion. This were enough to diſmay them, if there were any grace in them. But yet this is not all. For as man is offended with thoſe that riſe vp againſt him, and doth withall puniſh them according to their deſerts, if it lie in his power to do it; ſo is the Lord offended with them, and in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, he will plague them. His wrath is greatly kindled againſt them, and his hand ſhall be ſtretched out in a moſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner to torment them. Then at that time ſhall they know with a ſeeling and tormenting ſoule, what he is, againſt whom they are riſen vp; for God ſhall then diſcloſe it vnto them, ſaying: <hi>I haue ſet my king vpon Zion mine holy mountaine.</hi> He tooke not this honour vnto himſelfe, to be the head and ruler of my people, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he aduanced to this throne of gouernment by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority, or created wight; but I, euen I that am the Lord, whom the heauen of heauens cannot containe, placed him in his roome, &amp; made him to be the ſupreme gouernor of my people: how then durſt you rebel againſt him? or lift vp either tongue or hand, to ſpeak or do any thing which might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto him?</p>
            <p>The ſumme of theſe three verſes is nothing elſe but a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord (or the firſt perſon in the godhead) againſt whom the former treaſon or rebellion was wrought.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Summe. </seg>
               </label> Wherein (before we come to the parts of it) obſerue (in a word or two) the elegant <hi>Antitheſis</hi> that is made betwixt him and his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Firſt, they are many, but he is but one: Secondly, they are on the earth, but he is in heauen: Thirdly, they rage, murmure, band and conſult; but he laughs and ſmiles. Fourthly, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an ouerthrow to him, but he prepares plagues for them. Laſtly, they ſay, <hi>Come, let vs breake their bands, and caſt their cords behind vs:</hi> but he ſaith, <hi>I haue ſet my king vpon Zion mine holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi> So here is God againſt man, and heauen againſt earth. Iudge you now, who ſhall haue the victorie. But to the parts, the Lord here is deſcribed out two manner of wayes. The one is in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173667:49"/>regard of that which his enimies do to him. The other is of that which he will do to them. In the former of theſe, conſider the place where he is, then his deriding or laughing at his enimies: both which doe ſhew, that all their forces can do him no harme, but ſhall be fruſtrated and be brought to nought. Firſt, becauſe he is out of their reach, hee being in heauen, and they vpon the earth. Then ſecondly, becauſe he doth not feare, as men do, who are in ſome perilous danger, and too weake for their aduerſaries, but doth laugh and deride at them, as we are wont to do, when we are merrie and ſure of ſafetie, and do ſee how to fruſtrate all ſuch deuices as are intended againſt vs. This is ſet downe in the fourth verſe, as the other part is in the two next verſes following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he that is in heauen</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>doth laugh.</hi> Here I will ſtand a little vpon the ſeuerall members, and afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne them both together, in preſſing the doctrine and vſe of the place. God here (you ſee) is not plainely named, but he is ſee out by a certaine <hi>periphraſis,</hi> or circumlocution, euen by one that dwelleth, or as others reade it, by one that ſitteth in heauen; the Hebrew word <hi>Ioſheb</hi> affoordeth either of them; for it comes of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhab,</hi> which ſignifieth indifferently to dwell, or to ſit, as alſo to ſtay and to abide in a place. Howſoeuer, it is a notable deſcription of God, whereby the Prophet meaneth to ſhew, that his enimies are not able to do him any hurt, or mightie enough to ſtand againſt him that is ſo farre aboue them. For as it is euermore a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage in warre, to haue the vpper and higher place in fighting againſt the aduerſarie (as to be on a hil, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is below on a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley) ſo is it vnpoſſible for thoſe who are vpon the earth, to reach them with any blows or ſtrokes, that are in heauen. For betwixt theſe 2 places (heauen &amp; earth) as the Aſtronomers do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture, there are ſeuen ſcore &amp; eighteene thouſand, foure hundreth, and ſixtie three miles. And what arrow or ſhot of gun can flie ſo farre?</p>
            <p>But here it may be demanded,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
               </label> whether God be onely in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and not vpon the earth alſo? The anſwer is, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> that he is as well vpon the earth, as in the heauens, according to his owne words in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 23.24. where hee tells vs, that hee <hi>doth fill both the heauen and the earth.</hi> And this you muſt hold, as a ground infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, that he is in all places; for as <hi>Salomon</hi> doth confeſſe of him
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:173667:49"/>in 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.27. that the heauens, and the heauens of heauens are not able to conteine him: ſo <hi>Dauid</hi> doth teach vs in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he is euery where, as well in the ſea and earth and other places, as in the heauens themſelues. And the manner how he is thus in all places, is well expreſſed in an old verſe, which is this, <hi>Eſt Deus eſſenter, praeſenter, vbique potenter,</hi> That is: God is euery where by his eſſence, by his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; by his power. By his eſſence or diuine being, becauſe it is he that immediatly worketh al things, both in heauen &amp; earth. For we liue &amp; moue &amp; haue our being in him, as it is in <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.28. By his preſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeth &amp; beholdeth all things, &amp; euery matter is naked &amp; ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his eies, as thoſe are to ours, that ſtand in our preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce before vs, as it is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. By his power, becauſe he doth ſuſtaine and hold vp al the creatures in the whole world, their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; vertue being nothing elſe but as a ſmall portion, flowing from that wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of all fulneſſe, which is in him, as it is in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. and <hi>Math.</hi> 4.4. So that by this it is apparant, that God is not tied vp in the heauens, as hauing nothing to do here vpon the earth or ſea, as Atheiſts and Epicures iudge, who thinke that all things do fall out by the courſe of nature, chance, fortune (as they call it) and the policy of man. You ſee that he is in all places; he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with vs whereſoeuer we be: he doth conſider of all our workes: he doth know our ſitting downe, and our riſing vp: he doth vnderſtand our thoughts a farre off: he doth compaſſe our paths, and he is accuſtomed to all our wayes, as we may ſee moſt excellently in the beginning of that 139. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> which was quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before. And therefore euery man ſhould take heed, how he doth conuerſe and liue here in this pilgrimage before him. But yet he is ſayd rather to be in heauen, then in the earth or in any other place many times in the word, and that for two cauſes. The one is, becauſe he is moſt glorious there, and fulleſt of all honour and dignitie; that being the throne of his Maieſtie, whereas the earth is but his footſtoole, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.1. The other is, becauſe there he doth manifeſt himſelfe, as moſt of all, and in the greateſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie that may be, ſo immediatly, and not by meanes (whether ordinary, or extraordinary) as hee doth here in this world, as may be ſeene at large in the 21. <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Reuelations,</hi> and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173667:50"/>other places of the Scripture beſides. But the chiefe end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is here ſayd in our text which is in hand, to be in heauen, is to note the vnableneſſe of his enimies to do him hurt, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt him. Other ends there are of this ſaying elſewhere, but this is the onely and principall end of it here, and it is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for that purpoſe, as was obſerued before.</p>
            <p>But to come to the other member, as God is ſayd to ſit or dwell in heauen, ſo he is ſayd withall, to laugh and to make a mocke or deriſion of them. <hi>But he that dwelleth in heauen ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall haue them in deriſion.</hi> Some reade this in the preſent tenſe, ſaying, <hi>But he that dwelleth in heauen doth laugh, the Lord hath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in deriſion;</hi> or <hi>doth deride the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But we may take it as it is tranſlated in the future tenſe; for ſo it is in the Hebrew text. A man may laugh at the firſt; but weepe after; &amp; a man may make a deriſion of his enimie at the beginning, but come to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction himſelfe at the ending. But it ſhall not be ſo with God: he ſhall laugh both at the firſt, and at the laſt, and make a mocke of his aduerſaries as well at the ending as at the beginning. And therefore I thinke, the holy Ghoſt did of purpoſe rather expreſſe his mind in the future tenſe, then in the preſent tenſe: not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a preſent act, but to include the continuance of it, as though God did not onely do it now, but ſhould do it ſtill. His meaning is, that the Lord doth not feare the conſpiracies and rebellion of his enimies, which were mentioned in the three firſt verſes of this Pſalme, &amp; that he makes no account or reckning of them, but doth ſo lightly reſpect them, as matters that he both will and can daſh all to peeces, when it pleaſeth him. For here in this verſe and the next verſe following is a figure, called <hi>Anthropopatheia,</hi> which is, when things are ſpoken of God according to man, and as his capacity is able to comprehend. For we muſt not take the words literally, but figuratiuely; for to ſpeake properly, God doth not laugh, nor make a deriſion of any; onely man doth this, but he doth it not. And therefore I ſay, the words are to be taken figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely, as they alſo are which are aſcribed vnto wiſedome in the latter end of the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> when <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tels vs, that ſhe <hi>will laugh at the deſtruction of the wicked, and mocke when their feare commeth.</hi> If ſome fooliſh hare-braind
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:173667:50"/>youth of no ſtrength or skill, ſhould ſend a challenge vnto ſome wiſe diſcreet captaine of great valour and experience in warfare; the captaine would but laugh at him, and make a game-ſtocke of him, as knowing that he can do him no harme, but will eaſily without any ado be ouerthrown by him. So after the ſame maner, that we might know that the Lord feares none of his enimies, as ſuch as can do him no hurt, but that hee can eaſily at his pleaſure bring all their deuices to nought, &amp; ouercome them when he wil, he is ſaid here (after the maner of men) to laugh at them, &amp; to haue them in deriſion. God then laughes at his enemies, not becauſe he doth like of them, or of their attempts againſt him, as we doe oftentimes laugh at ſuch things as pleaſe vs well; but becauſe hee cares not for them, and doth ſee that all their plots are in vaine which are intended againſt him.</p>
            <p>But why is this doubled, may you ſay? for what cauſe doth the Prophet tell vs of one thing thing twiſe? Firſt, he ſaith, that <hi>God ſhall laugh at them:</hi> then after that he ſaith againe, that <hi>he ſhall haue them in deriſion:</hi> For ſeeing to laugh at one, and to haue him in deriſion is all one, and the one of them doth not differ from the other in ſenſe and meaning, the queſtion may bee well moued, why the Prophet ſhould vſe them both, and not content himſelfe with one of them alone? The anſwere is this, that he did it, the better to note out the certainty and aſſuredneſſe of the thing whereof he doth ſpeake. For as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreames were doubled, the one of the kine, the other of the corne, becauſe the thing which he ſaw in his dreames, was eſtabliſhed by God, and God did ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to performe it; as it is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32. So the Prophet here doth double his words, becauſe the matter whereof he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is moſt certaine and ſure, and ſuch as he would haue no man to doubt thereof. And for this purpoſe (you know) doe we our ſelues oftentimes double our ſayings, and therefore it is as much in effect, as if he had ſaid: <hi>But hee that dwelleth in the heauen ſhall laugh, yea I ſay againe, the Lord ſhall laugh, and haue them in deriſion; doubt not of it, but beleeue it, for it is a thing moſt certaine and true, as heauen it ſelfe.</hi> The conſideration whereof ſhould make vs bee afraid to doe any thing againſt the Lord. For of all things we do abhorre this moſt, to be made a laughing ſtocke and a may-game
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173667:51"/>to our aduerſaries. The Saints do complaine of it in the 44. pſalme. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> in the 8. chapter of his propheſie. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in the 22. pſalme. And <hi>Paul</hi> in the 4 chapter of his 1. epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And ſurely if this bee tart and irkeſome vnto Gods owne children, how ſhall the wicked bee able to beare it? Yet here we ſee, that God doth make a ſport at all his aduerſaries, and doth laugh and deride at them. Oh let the due regard of this phraſe or manner of ſpeech, ſtay vs alwayes from all rebellion againſt him, and cauſe vs to bee vpright in our wayes. For ſhall we be a laughter and deriſion vnto the Almightie? No, no, beware we of that.</p>
            <p>But to leaue the ſeuerall members (wheron many things might be obſerued, if need did ſo require) &amp; to conioyne them together as they ought to be, out of them we gather this doctrine: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> That no power or deuice of man ſhall bee able to ſtand againſt the Lord, but ſhal be ouerthrowne and be brought to nought. For this is the end (as you haue heard) why theſe two things are reported of God, the one of his being in heauen, the other of his laughing at his aduerſaries, euen to ſhew that that conſpiracy which was made againſt him &amp; his annoynted, ſhould not proſper or preuaile, but vaniſh &amp; come to nothing. So that the doctrine is rightly collected out of the text; and it may be proued vnto vs out of ſundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſacred Writ, but I wil touch ſome two or three onely at this time, and ſo paſſe it ouer. The firſt is out of the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> in the 8 chapter of his propheſie, and the 9. and 10 verſes thereof, when he ſaith; <hi>Gather together on heaps ô yee people, and yee ſhall bee broken to peeces, and hearken ye of farre countries: Gird your ſelues, &amp; you ſhall bee broken in peeces: gird your ſelues, and you ſhall bee broken in peeces. Take counſell together, and it ſhall be brought to nought: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a decree, yet ſhall it not ſtand: for God is with vs.</hi> The ſecond is in the 33. Pſalme, &amp; the 10. &amp; 11. verſes thereof, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: <hi>The Lord breaketh the counſell of the heathen, and bringeth to nought the deuices of the people. The counſell of the Lord ſhall ſtand for euer, and the thoughts of his heart throughout all ages.</hi> The third and laſt is the 12. chapter of the <hi>Reuelations,</hi> and the 7. and 8 verſes thereof, where <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>And there was a battell in heauen,</hi> Michael <hi>and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon, and the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:173667:51"/>Dragon fought and his Angels. But they preuailed not, neither was their place found any more in heauen.</hi> Thus you ſee that nothing can ſtand againſt the Lord, but all doth come to nought that is raiſed vp againſt him.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon thereof is this, partly becauſe he is wiſer then all, ſeeing which way to preuent his enemies, and to bring his owne purpoſe to paſſe; and partly becauſe hee is ſtronger then all, being able to doe whatſoeuer hee will, both in heauen and earth, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> words in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. when hee ſaith: <hi>For the fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then men, and the weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vſe of this doctrine is manifold,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> but yet it ſtandeth chiefly in three things. The firſt is, to teach vs what ſhall bee the end of all the plots which the wicked haue in their ſoules againſt the Lord, and ſuch as do cleaue vnto him. They ſhal vaniſh and come to nothing, being like in this reſpect as the child in the mothers wombe, that there doth periſh, and neuer come aline into this world: or like vnto his dreame who is buſie all the night in his ſleepe about gold and rich preferments, and yet in the morning is as poore as when he went to bed. In a word, they do but loſe their labour, as he doth who goeth about by waſhing to make a Black-moore-white: or by teaching to make an aſſe play vpon an harpe. Let this be a continuall meditation with vs euery day and night.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, to pull vs backe from all ſuch matters as doe tend any manner of way againſt the Lord. For let vs aſſure our owne ſoules, that if we attempt any ſuch thing, wee ſhall haue no good ſucceſſe therein, but our endeuours ſhall bee brought to nought. I beſeech you remember what <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſaid, and follow his counſell which he gaue vnto the Iewes when they ſtroue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Apoſtles, and went about to hinder all preaching in the name of Chriſt. <hi>Men of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take heede to your ſelues, what you intend to do, touching theſe men: refraine your ſelues from them, and let them alone. For if this counſell, or this worke, be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot deſtroy it, leſt ye bee found euen ſighters againſt God,</hi> as it is in <hi>Acts</hi> 5, 35, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
               </label> None of vs are ſo beaſtly as to fight againſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173667:52"/>the Lord himſelfe.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> 
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Let no man be deceiued. For we doe all of vs warre againſt him many wayes, and as in generall, when wee doe violate and breake his ſtatutes, refuſing to doe that which he hath commanded vs for to do: ſo in particular we doe it foure manner of waies, The one is when we oppoſe our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Magiſtrates of the common wealth, whom hee hath ſet ouer vs for to rule &amp; gouerne vs For to reſiſt them is to reſiſt God himſelfe, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſhew in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.2. Another is when we doe oppoſe our ſelues againſt the Miniſters of the Church, whom he hath raiſed vp to teach and inſtruct vs. For to reſiſt them is to reſiſt God himſelfe, as Chriſt hath taught vs in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. The third is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do oppoſe our ſelues againſt the word of God, and ſuch heauenly ordinances of his as he hath beſtowed vpon men for his owne worſhip, and the ſaluation of mans ſoule. For to reſiſt them is to reſiſt God himſelfe, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> doth inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate in the place of the <hi>Acts.</hi> before quoted. The fourth and laſt is, when wee doe oppoſe our ſelues againſt the children of God, and the members of leſus Chriſt. For to reſiſt them is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt God himſelfe, as <hi>Zecharie</hi> doth declare, in <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. All theſe wayes do men in euery place almoſt lift vp themſelues againſt the Lord: but beware we that we ioyne not with them therein; but let vs cary our ſelues holy and reuerently in all theſe reſpects, as we ought to do: otherwiſe we ſhall be croſt in our purpoſes, and pay moſt dearely for it at the laſt.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt is to comfort vs, who haue ſuch a ſtrong and wiſe God on our ſide, that nothing can preuaile againſt him. It is a great comfort vnto a man to ſerue ſuch a maiſter as will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies take his part, &amp; ſee him wronged by no man: but then eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is his heart exhilerated with much ioy &amp; alacritie, when he doth vnderſtand that none is able to make his part good with his maiſter, but he doth alwaies preuaile againſt all. What a conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then and ioy of ſpirit ought it to be vnto vs, ſeeing our maiſter &amp; Lord whom we ſerue, is not only omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in himſelfe, being ſtronger then all, but alſo ſo louing to vs, that hee doth alwaies take our part, and ſo aſſiſt vs from time to time, that we ſhall ſtill ouercome our foes, and not bee vanquiſhed by them? Oh let vs ponder often on this poynt. For it will be a good cordial medicine
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173667:52"/>vnto vs in all diſeaſes whatſoeuer, and it will reuiue vs like <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> or <hi>roſa Solis</hi> when we are ready to faint or ſinke.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you haue heard a deſcription of the Lord in regard of that which his enimies do to him. Now you muſt marke how he is deſcribed in reſpect of that which he will do to them. And that is alſo two manner of waies, the one is by his workes, the other is by his words: by his works in the firſt verſe, and by his words in the fixth verſe. His workes containe his anger againſt them, and the effects thereof, which are fearefull plagues tormenting them. The ſpeech is allegoricall and drawne from man, as was touched before: for the Prophet doth ſpeake of God according to man, and as hee is well able to conceiue of him: not that there is any paſſion of choler or anger in God, as there is in man (for he is free from all paſſions whatſoeuer;) but the meaning is, that God was much offended with them for their rebellion, and ſo are diſpleaſed with them for it. And whereas man is angry and wrathfull, he wil ſtrike and lay on, and take reuenge vpon ſuch as do offend him: ſo the Lord would be reuenged vpon them, and plague them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts, as being highly offended with them for their euill wayes and rebellion againſt him. <hi>Then ſhall hee ſpeake vnto them in his wrath</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>and vexe them in his ſoare diſpleaſure.</hi> That is, ouer &amp; beſides his former deriding of them, or laughing at them, he ſhal be exceeding much offended with them, &amp; in his ſoare diſpleaſure againſt them he ſhal confound them, &amp; and bring ſuch iudgements vpon them, that they ſhall bee vexed with the cruell paine and remedileſſe griefe thereof. So then here is ſet downe how the Lord takes the matter at his enimies hands, and how they ſhall ſpeede for the ſame; though he doth laugh, yet he is angry, and much offended with them for it; and though they be many &amp; great ones, yet they ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed, but be plagued according to their wretched waies. For Gods ſpeaking here vnto them is not by word of mouth, but by ſtroake of hand. Sometimes he ſpeakes by word of mouth vnto men, as he did heretofore by his Prophets and Apoſtles, and as hee doth ſtill vnto vs by the holy Scriptures, and the faithfull expoſitors thereof. Otherwhiles againe he ſpeakes to men by the ſtroakes of his hand, as euer he hath done, and daily doth, when he doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:173667:53"/>them for their ſinnes, and lay ſome iudgements vpon them for their iniquities. Of this manner of ſpeaking doth <hi>Elihu</hi> make mention in <hi>Iob, cap.</hi> 33. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. and ſo forward, where hee doth ſhew, that God doth not onely ſpeake to men by dreames and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the night, pulling them as it were by the eares, and leauing euen in their minds an impreſſion of thoſe great puniſhments which hang ouer their heads, to this end, that he might warne and teach them, to lay aſide thoſe things which they were intended to do, and that he might for bid them to continue in their wicked enterpriſes: but alſo when man will not take heed by theſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, he goeth on the ſecond time to ſpeake vnto him by his ſtroakes and iudgements, in laying ſome grieuous ſickeneſſe vpon his body, whereby he is brought as it were to deaths dore, being daily tormented with grieuous paine, euen as he lyeth on his bed, and being ſo changed through leanneſſe, and the rage of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, that he is rather like to them that lye in the graue, then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the liuing.</p>
            <p>Now after this manner is the word here to be taken, as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the place doth ſhew, and as the words following doe declare. And the word alſo here vſed in the Hebrew tongue, called <hi>Iedabber,</hi> comming of the root <hi>Dabar,</hi> doth ſignifie as well to deſtroy (as ſome iudge) as to ſpeak. So that a man may tranſlate it (if he will) after this ſort: <hi>Then ſhall he destroy them in his wrath, and vexe them in his ſore diſpleaſure.</hi> But howſoeuer, you ſee the ſenſe and meaning is all one, and that the Prophet doth intend no other thing hereby, but to ſhew, that they ſhall be ouerthrowne, and come to ſome fearefull ends, that did ſo riſe vp againſt the Lord and his Annoynted, as you heard in the beginning of this Pſalme. And that this alſo did fall out accordingly, and in the ſame manner, as the text doth here ſpeake, was at large deliuered vnto you in my firſt lecture vpon this Pſalme, when I did runne ouer the whole body thereof at once together: and therefore I will not now ſtand vpon it againe, but referre you onely vnto that which was then ſpoken, hoping that you haue it in good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance ſtill to your ſweet comfort and holy inſtruction.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the place at this time to be conſidered, is this, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> That the enimies of Gods Church ſhall be ouerthrowne, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:173667:53"/>be confounded by the breath of the Almighty for their rebellion againſt him, euen as the enimies of <hi>Dauid</hi> and Chriſt here were for their reſiſting of him. Surely as they came to fearefull ends; ſo ſhall thoſe that riſe vp from time to time againſt Gods children, they, euen they alſo, ſhall come to fearefull ends. <hi>The Lord that is at their right hand, ſhall wound Kings in the day of his wrath, he ſhall be iudge among the heathen, he ſhall fill and with dead bodies, and ſmite the head ouer great countries,</hi> as it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.5.6. You know what God doth ſaith to <hi>Edom. For thy cruelty</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>againſt thy brother</hi> Iacob, <hi>ſhame ſhall couer thee, and thou ſhalt be cut off for euer. Obadiah verſ.</hi> 10. You know what God doth ſay of <hi>Moah,</hi> and of the children of <hi>Ammon. I haue heard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the reproach of</hi> Moab, <hi>and therebukes of the children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>whereby they vpbraided my people, and magnified themſelues againſt their borders. Therefore as I liue, ſaith the Lord God of hoaſts, the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Surely</hi> Moab <hi>ſhall be as</hi> Sodom, <hi>and the children of</hi> Ammon <hi>as</hi> Gomorah: <hi>euen the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of nettles, and ſalt-pits, and a perpetuall deſolation; the reſidue of my folke ſhall spoile them, &amp; the remnant of my people ſhall poſſeſſe them. This ſhall they haue for their pride, becauſe they haue reproached, and magnified themſelues againſt the Lord of hoaſts people,</hi> in Zeph. 2.8.9.10. You know what God doth ſay to <hi>Abraham. I will alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bleſſe them that bleſſe thee, and curſe them that curſe thee,</hi> in Gen. 12.3. And what he ſaith to his whole people of <hi>Iſrael. Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will bruiſe all that afflict thee, ſo that none ſhall be ſpared,</hi> in Zeph. 3.19. Laſtly you know (to pretermit other places) what God doth to that huge army of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> that compaſſeth the Saints and holy citty about, ſpoken of in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20.9. <hi>But fire</hi> (ſaith the text there) <hi>came downe from God out of heauen, and deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them.</hi> To this we might adde many examples, if neede did ſo require: as that of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who were plagued with ten ſeuerall plagues from heauen, one comming after another, and in the end were drowned (the moſt of them) in the redde ſea, for ſetting themſelues againſt the Lords people the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As that of <hi>Haman,</hi> who loſt all his dignity, and the great honour which he had, &amp; in the end was hanged vpon a gallowes, for ſeeking the ouerthrow of <hi>Mordecay,</hi> and thoſe of the Iewes as did belong to the Lord. As laſtly that (with diuers others) of the whole
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:173667:54"/>nation of the Iewes themſelues, who were ſundry times plagued by God from heauen, and by men from the earth, and in the end came to the woefulleſt calamitie, as euer pen did put to paper, for killing the Prophets from time to time, and for murdering Chriſt, and ſuch as did appertaine vnto him. So that whereas they cryed out and ſaid: <hi>His bloud be vpon vs and our children,</hi> as it is in <hi>Math.</hi> 27.25. his bloud indeed fell vpon them; for they were ſo puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, that they were murdered moſt of them at the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> their bloud running about the ſtreets like a riuer of water; and they are now to this day in great contempt amongſt all nations; as many thouſands of them alſo do lye boyling in hell, and there ſhall remaine in their torments for it, for euermore. O miſery of all miſeries! Great was their calamitie, when their citty was beſieged, at what time they were driuen to eate the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their ſhooes, the leather of their girdles, the leather of their bucklers, and targets, the dung of their ſtables, and in the end their very children. Woefull was their caſe, when they began to iſſue out, compelled with famine, when they were ſtill taken and crucified vpon croſſes, and gibbets ſet vp before the wals, that they which were within might ſee them, and giue ouer, but yet they would not: fiue hundred a day were thus hanged vp, till there were neither trees to be gotten, nor any more ſpace left to ſet them in. Fearefull was their eſtate, when certaine of them, getting meate for compaſſion ſake in the campe of the enimes, were yet ſo perſecuted with the anger of God, that when they hoped their liues were in ſome ſafety, ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly in the night by the bloody ſouldiers (imagining that ſure they had Gold and Iewels within them, which they had ſwallowed to conuey them for their vſe) were miſerably flaine, and ſlit vp, their bowels taked in for that which haply was not there, to the number of two thouſand in one night. Pittifull was their condition, when there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the number of dead carkaſſes carried out of the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for want of buriall, to be throwne into the ditches, as dung vpon the earth; but the number was numberleſſe, and no way to know it certainely, but out of one gate the keeper had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be carried out an hundred and fifty thouſand dead bodies. Who can ſpeake or heare of theſe matters, almoſt with dry eyes?
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173667:54"/>But yet this is not the worſt, for the damnation of their ſoules and bodies in hell doth go far beyond it, where is weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth for euermore. Alas, alas, our hearts may breake out into drops of bloud, to thinke vpon that their miſery. For firſt, their paine there is intollerable, farre worſe then the burning of any fire with vs, let it be a thouſand times hotter then it is. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it is eternall, and euerlaſting, neuer to haue any end, like that fire which doth alwaies burne, and can neuer be quenched. And thirdly it is continuall without any intermiſſion or eaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming betwixt it, they lying in torments euery day, and euery night, and not hauing ſo much as one minute of an houre in a million of yeares to reſt in. Thus doth God <hi>ſpeake to them in his wrath, and vexe them in his ſore diſpleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon hereof is this,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
               </label> becauſe he is offended with them for their ſinne which they doe commit herein againſt him, and hath the ſame in great hatred and deteſtation. For as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth tell vs in the 5. and 11. Pſalmes, that <hi>the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in the Lords ſight,</hi> nor <hi>him that ſpeaketh lies, but ſhall be deſtroyed; and that vpon the wicked he ſhall raine ſnares, fire, and brimſtone, and ſtormy tempeſt, this is the portion of their cup:</hi> ſo he doth teach vs withall, what is the cauſe thereof, in the ſame places, namely this, <hi>becauſe he is not a God that loueth wickedneſſe nor iniquitie, neither ſhall euill dwell with him; but he is one that loueth righteouſneſſe, and hateth iniquity, and ſuch as worke the ſame.</hi> The places aboue quoted doe touch this matter, and ſhew the particular ſinne, for which theſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come. But yet a man may aſke &amp; ſay: Why is God ſo much moued for the wrongs that are offered to his children: Wherefore doth the ſinne committed againſt them, ſo ſtirre him to wrath, and indignation againſt the offenders therein? Cannot he be quiet whilſt he himſelfe is not touched? and ſo lightly paſſe ouer the matter? No, no, he cannot in any ſort. For if you touch them once, you touch him. <hi>He that toucheth you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zechariah</hi> to Gods children, in <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. <hi>toucheth the apple of his eye.</hi> I trow, if a man take in your eyes, you will ſet him further, if you can, and teach him what it is to medle with that tender member, that is ſo deare vnto you. So doth the Lord deale with theſe: becauſe his children are deare and precious vnto him, he cannot ſee them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:173667:55"/>wronged, but muſt needes take their parts, and be reuenged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their aduerſaries for ſuch abuſes as they do offer vnto them. <hi>Becauſe thou waſt precious in my ſight</hi> (ſaith the Lord to Iſrael) <hi>and thou waſt honorable, and I loued theee, therefore will I giue man for thee, and people for thy ſake,</hi> as it is in <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.4. And as though this were not enough, the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> doth tell vs, That <hi>he is iealous ouer his people, that he reſerueth wrath for his enimies, that he will take vengeance on his aduerſaries, and make an vtter destruction of them, comming like a fire vnto them, as vnto thornes folden one in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and as vnto drunkards in their drunkenneſſe: ſo that they ſhall be deuoured as stubble fully dried. Nahum</hi> 1.2.9.10. This is the cauſe and reaſon, wherefore the Lord doth ſo take on; in regard whereof Chriſt ſaid vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> when he did moleſt and trouble ſuch as did beleeue in him, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why dost thou perſecute me?</hi> as it is in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.4. taking that to be done to himſelfe, which was done to them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore out of this place we may learne,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> firſt to abſtaine from all ſuch things as are iniurious vnto Gods Saints, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto ſuch as do belong to him. <hi>What do you imagine</hi> (ſaith <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum</hi> the Prophet) <hi>against the Lord? he will make an vtter deſtruction, affliction ſhall not riſe vp the ſecond time. Chap.</hi> 1.9. Becauſe the Lord will deſtroy thoſe that imagine euill againſt his people, therefore the Prophet doth thinke it to be meere fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe to attempt any thing againſt them, and good wiſedome to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and to let them alone. One reaſon we had before for this, which is, our not preuailing againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but this is more ſtrong &amp; forcible then that. For all men by nature do deſire moſt their eaſe and ſafety, but here is a thing which will bring woe and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto vs: it will take away our eaſe and ſafety cleane, &amp; plunge vs into a ſea of miſeries, vexing our ſoules whiles we are here, and tormenting both body, and ſoule, when we are gone from hence. And therefore, I beſeech you (brethren) in the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath loued vs, and giuen his life for our ſakes, let there be none amongſt vs which do wiſh euill vnto <hi>Zion,</hi> but let vs loue all thoſe which do feare the Lord: if no other thing can moue vs to it, yet let Gods iudgements which otherwiſe will fall vpon vs, bring vs vnto it. O remember, it is no ſporting
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173667:55"/>matter, to make a ieſt and ſport of Gods child: neither is it a ſmall matter to offer wrongs and iniuries vnto him, but thus to do is an hainous offence, &amp; a very da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous matter to al thoſe that do it. If <hi>Meroz</hi> muſt be curſed, &amp; all the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not foorth to helpe Gods people againſt their enimies (as indeed they muſt be curſed, according to the words of the Angell in <hi>Iudges, Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23:) And if they muſt depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, &amp; be caſt into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the diuell and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who do not feed the hungry, cloath the naked, viſit the ſicke, &amp; do good to thoſe that are his Diſciples and do beleeue in him, (as they muſt indeed depart from him, and goe to that fearefull place, as we may ſee by <hi>Mathew, Chapter</hi> 25. <hi>verſe</hi> 41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) How much more ſhall they be curſed, that do reſiſt the people of God? and how much more ſhall they depart from Chriſt, and be caſt into euerlaſting fire prepared for the deuill and his Angels, who do rob the faithfull Diſciples of Chriſt, and offer violence and wrong vnto them? Oh thinke on this, ye that forget God, leſt he come and teare you in peeces, before you be aware, and there be none to helpe you.</p>
            <p>But to proceede on, here in the ſecond place we may learne to be quiet and patient, when we are moleſted and troubled by the wicked; wee need not then to fret and chafe as many are wont to do, but to be mild, as Chriſt was, and to commit all vnto God, as he did; according to <hi>Peters</hi> words in his firſt Epiſtle, the 2, <hi>chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and 23. <hi>verſe</hi> thereof, with ſome others following; where he doth labour to draw men to the imitation of our Sauiour in his ſuffering, that as he, <hi>when hee was reuiled, reuiled not againe, and when hee ſuffered, hee threatned not, but committed all to him, that iudgeth righteouſly:</hi> ſo ſhould they do, bearing euery thing patiently, and referring it vnto him that iudgeth iuſtly without any acceptation of perſons. For ſeeing that God will reuenge our quarrels, and plague our enemies to the vttermoſt, we our ſelues may be ſilent and dumbe, and neither mooue hand or tongue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Wherefore let vs do as <hi>Paul</hi> doth aduiſe vs for to do, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Dearely beloued</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>auenge not your ſelues, but giue place vnto wrath, for it is written, vengeance is mine: &amp; I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> If any do abuſe vs, deride vs, or offer any wrong &amp;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173667:56"/>iniurie vnto vs, let vs not ſtorme and fret therat, but let vs poſſeſſe our ſoules with patience, remembring with our ſelues alwaies, that we haue a ſweet and gratious God in heauen, who doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what is done vnto vs, and who will alſo in due time be auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon our aduerſaries for it, when they ſhall mourne and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; we on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſide ſhall laugh &amp; reioyce. That is a moſt comfortable ſaying which is in the 7 <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Prophecie of <hi>Micha,</hi> in the eigth, ninth, and tenth verſes, when he ſaith, <hi>Reioyce not againſt me, ô mine enimy; though I fall, I ſhall ariſe, &amp;c.</hi> I pray, read the place at your leaſure, and peruſe it well.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come vnto the laſt vſe, which we are to make of this place, and that is, a dutie which is to be performed of vs. For it doth become vs vpon this to reioyce and to breake out into prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to extoll the Lord, who doth ſo fight our battels, and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the enimie before vs, in ſuch a fearefull manner, that he is wholly ouerthrowne, and can haue no reſt, but lies in continuall griefe, and vexation of minde. <hi>O Iudah</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Nahum, Chapter</hi> 1.15.) <hi>keepe thy ſolemne feaſtes, performe thy vowes, for the wicked ſhall no more paſſe through thee, he is vtterly cut off.</hi> And <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany</hi> ſaith: <hi>Reioyce ô daughter Zion, be ye ioyfull ô Iſrael, be glad &amp; reioyce with all thy heart, ô daughter</hi> Ieruſalem. <hi>The Lord hath taken away thy iudgements, he hath cast out thine enimie, the King of Iſrael, euen the Lord is in the midſt of thee, thou ſhalt ſee no more euill.</hi> Both which places (you ſee) do declare, that we muſt reioyce, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in our ſongs of praiſe vnto the Lord, when he doth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our enimies, and beate them downe before vs: And hereof we haue many worthy examples in the holy Scriptures, I will touch onely a few of them. <hi>Moſes</hi> and thoſe which came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> with him did the ſame, when the Lord had deſtroyed their enimies the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> &amp; had drowned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all in the red ſea, as we may ſee at large in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1. <hi>&amp;c. Deborah</hi> and thoſe which were with her &amp; on her ſide, did the ſame, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne their aduerſaries the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> &amp; had deſtroyed <hi>Siſera</hi> their chiefe captaine, and all his chariots, and all his hoaſt with the edge of the ſword, as it is in <hi>Iudges</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The good and holy women who liued in the daies of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> did the ſame, when the Lord had confounded the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> their foes, and had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:173667:56"/>brought an horrible ſlaughter vpon them, and vpon their chiefe champion, that great &amp; blaſphemous <hi>Goliah,</hi> that defied the hoaſt of Iſrael, and railed vpon the God thereof, as it is euident in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.6.7. Finally, <hi>Heſter</hi> &amp; <hi>Mordecay</hi> with their people, &amp; ſuch of the Iewes as liued in their times, did the ſame, when the Lord had ſtrengthened them againſt their oppoſites, and had brought an vtter ruine vnto their chiefe aduerſarie <hi>Haman</hi> the curſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekite,</hi> as appeareth in <hi>Eſter</hi> 9.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, euen ſo, beloued, let vs deale from time to time, whenſoeuer the Lord doth giue vs a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ouer our aduerſaries, and bring iuſt and deſerued plagues vpon them, let vs bleſſe his holy name for the ſame, and reioyce greatly before him in that behalfe. And ſo farre of Gods workes. Now let vs come to his words.</p>
            <q>I haue ſet my King vpon Zion mine holy mountaine.</q>
            <p>Theſe are not the words of the Prophet, but of God himſelfe ſitting in iudgement, and taking reuenge vpon his aduerſaries, that rebel againſt him &amp; his anoynted. Not that God ſhall whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth ſtrike them, vtter theſe words in plaine termes, and ſound of voyce vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as we do vtter words, when we beate ſuch as haue offended vs; but the meaning is, that they ſhal by their plagues &amp; ſore iudgements executed vpon them, feele and perceiue this to be ſo, as plainly &amp; as euidently, as if they heard the Lord ſpeaking from heauen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by word of mouth. His deſtroying &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of them ſhal cry like a ſhril voice in their eares, that it was he himſelfe &amp; no created wight, euen he himſelfe that is the God of Gods, &amp; the Lord of hoaſts, that did ſet vp <hi>Dauid</hi> to be King of Iſrael, &amp; Chriſt his Son to be King of his Church, whom they had ſo rebelliouſly reſiſted, &amp; laboured to haue diſplaced out of their thrones. Here is a great <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> &amp; it is as much as if he had ſaid: What? ſhal I ſet vp a King? &amp; will you, ô ye rebels go about to put him downe? How dare you do this? What? ſhall I place one ouer my people, &amp; make him to be their Lord and chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, &amp; will you, ye traytors, refuſe to yeeld obedience vnto him, &amp; ioine hand and head together to ouerthrow him, and to remoue him out of his kingdome? O impietie neuer heard of! O wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe moſt intollerable! Know you, know you, that for this cauſe I cannot beare with you, but I muſt needes ſpeake to you in my
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:173667:57"/>wrath, and vexe you in my ſore diſpleaſure, as now I do.</p>
            <p>By Zion here, his holy mountaine, the kingdome of Iſrael is vnderſtood, if we referre it vnto <hi>Dauid;</hi> but if we referre it vnto Chriſt, the Church is meant thereby. Zion was the citie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the place where his Court was vſually held and kept, as it is in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.7. But here it is put figuratiuely for the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael, whereof that was a chiefe and principall part. And it is tearmed withall, the holy mountaine of God, becauſe it ſtood on high vpon a mountaine or hill, where the Lord did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his holineſſe vnto his people, as by the preſence of his arke which was there, ſo alſo by the exerciſes of pure religion which were held in the Tabernacle and Temple, that were built in that place, and feared vpon that mountaine or hill. Thus literally this place is to be referred vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and it is true of him, that God did ſet him vp as King ouer this kingdome of Iſrael, as we may ſee in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12, 13. But ſacramentally, and after a ſpirituall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner theſe thing are to be referred vnto Chriſt and his Church. For Zion alſo was a type thereof, as we may ſee in <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.3. and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. And Chriſt we know, was choſen of his Father to bee the head and King thereof, as anone, by Gods grace, ſhall more fully appeare. And as the earthly Zion was tearmed the mountaine of Gods holineſſe, ſo may this heauenly. Zion well beare that appellation or name. For I. it is moſt like vnto a mountaine: then 2. the Lord doth manifeſt his holineſſe more there then in any other place. It is moſt like a mountaine in 3. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Firſt, for the exaltation and ſupereminencie of it: for as a mountaine is an high place aboue other places, ſo the Church of God is exalted aboue other congregations; and that for Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, and moſt excellent bleſſings vpon it, which are either preſent, or to come. Secondly, for the manifeſtation and aptneſſe of it: for as a mountaine is in open ſight &amp; view of all men: ſo the Church of God ſtands in the eie-ſight of all perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; euery mans eye is bent to mark diligently what they do, as his eare is open to liſten to that which they ſpeake. Thirdly, for the ſtrength and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of it: for as a mountaine is a ſtrong thing and vnmouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſo the Church of God is ſo ſtrong and inuincible, that all the powers of the world, and of hell below cannot ouerthrow it, but
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:173667:57"/>it ſhall remaine firme and ſtable (notwithſtanding the ſame) for euermore. I beſeech you by the way, make vſe of all theſe things. By the firſt, looke vpon your honour and great aduancements, wherunto you are exalted aboue all others. As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in the <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 31, 29: <hi>Many daughters haue done vertuouſly: but thou ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountest them all:</hi> ſo you may ſay, Many congregations in the world are exalted on high; but we (the true Church) are lifted vp aboue them all. By the ſecond, be moued to haue an holy care of your liues, that you may walk circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpectly at all times in the waies of godlines, &amp; that <hi>your light may ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.</hi> And by the third and laſt, be ſecretly comforted, and grow to a full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate you from the loue of your God, but that you ſhall remaine firme and ſtable in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour for euermore.</p>
            <p>Now for the other poynt, as the Church is like to a mountaine, ſo it is holy, as the mountaine Zion was. Firſt, for the Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, who is holineſſe it ſelfe: for though he be in all the world, yet hee is more eſpecially in his Church then in any other place beſides, according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.16. and 48.1.2. Secondly, for the holy exerciſes of religion, and the goodly works of Gods worſhip which are found therein: for there is prayer, ſinging of Pſalmes, reading and preaching of the word, receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and the like; all which are workes of holineſſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Laſtly, for the ſanctification of men and women, which are therein: for they are not prophane and licentious, as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but they are ſanctified &amp; made holy by the bloud of Chriſt, &amp; the working of the Spirit. Our of theſe things alſo, gather ſome ſhort notes as we go along. Let the firſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make you reioice &amp; be glad, that you haue ſo good a God, that though he be full of maieſty &amp; glory, yet he is content to come home to your houſes, and to dwell in the chambers of your ſoules, and there to quiet himſelfe in your loue and to reioyce ouer you with ioy, as <hi>Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> doth ſpeake in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. As <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaid, when the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came to her: <hi>Whence commeth this to me, that the mother of my Lord ſhould come to me? Luke.</hi> 1.43. ſo may we ſay at the Lords comming to vs: What a fauour and dignitie is this, that the Lord
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:173667:58"/>of heauen and earth ſhould thus come to vs? Let the ſecond of them ſtirre you vp to freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t holy exerciſes, and to throng to the houſe of praier, and to ſuch places where the Lord is rightly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. As the nations ſay in <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Come, and let vs go vp to the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain of the Lord, &amp; to the houſe of the God of Iacob:</hi> ſo let vs ſay, Come, &amp; let vs go to the Church &amp; congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to the preaching of the word, &amp; to other holy exerciſes of pure &amp; holy religion. Let the third and laſt of them admoniſh you of that purity &amp; holineſſe which ought to be in you, that ſo you may neuer giue reſt vnto your eies vntil you ſee your ſelues waſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ſins by the bloud of Chriſt, &amp; made holy in ſome part by the ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods ſpirit, wherby you may be able to go boldly vnto the throne of grace to receiue mercy, &amp; to find grace to helpe in time of need. That as <hi>Paul</hi> did ſay of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> when they were changed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bad to good: <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but yee are ſanctified, but ye are iuſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the ſpirit of God,</hi> as it is in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. ſo may you ſay of your ſelues: And ſuch were we our ſelues once, euen bad and moſt wicked perſons; but bleſſed be God we are now changed, and made better: our ſinnes are waſhed away by the bloud of Chriſt, and the ſpirit of God hath begun to renew vs in ſome good part.</p>
            <p>Leauing theſe things for the meaning of the words, and ſome ſhort annotations vpon the ſame, let vs now come to the maine doctrine of the place, and in few words it is nothing elſe but this, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that Chriſt our Sauiour did not take this office vpon him to be the King of the Church, but was lawfully called thereunto by God his Father, and not by any created power whatſoeuer. This he confeſſeth of himſelfe in <hi>Iohn, Chapter</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 27. Where he doth endeauour to draw men from a greedy hunting after the foode of the body, vnto a carefull ſeeking for the foode of their ſoules: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Labour not for the meate which periſheth, but for the meate that endureth vnto euerlaſting life, which the Sonne of man ſhall giue you, for him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> He hath choſen him for this purpoſe, and ſet his marke and ſeale vpon him, as deſigning him ouer this worke and buſineſſe, which is to be performed alone by him, and none elſe. And this alſo he doth proue in the fourth <hi>chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the Goſpell according to Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> by a teſtimony out of <hi>Eſay, chap.</hi> 61.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the calling of the Meſſias is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173667:58"/>and at large ſet out vnto vs. But the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (not to ſtand vpon other places) doth make this point moſt cleare and euident vnto all perſons, in the firſt <hi>chapter</hi> of his Epiſtle to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi> beginning at the twentieth verſe therof and ſo forward, &amp; in the ſecond <hi>chapter</hi> of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> in the ninth verſe thereof, with others following. For in both theſe places you ſhall finde, that as Chriſt is exalted aboue all the creatures in the world, and made the ſupreme head of the Church, both warring in earth, &amp; triumphing in heauen; ſo he was raiſed vp hereunto by God his Father, he making him thus the vniuerſall gouernour of all the world. So that looke what the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaid of Chriſt in regard of his Prieſt-hood, that <hi>he tooke not to himſelfe that honour to be made the high Prieſt, but he that ſaid vnto him, Thou art my Son, this day begat I thee,</hi> gaue it him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. So may we ſay here of him in regard of his kingdome, that he tooke not this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to himſelfe, to be made the ſupreme King of the Church, but God that ſitteth in the heauens, and hath his enimies in deriſion, gaue it vnto him: but ſomewhat more of this hereafter when we come vnto the 8. verſe of this Pſalme.</p>
            <p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
               </label> But why did God (may you ſay) ſet vp Chriſt and make him thus the King of his Church? Wherefore did he not make choiſe rather of ſome Angell or Arch-angell, or of ſome Emperour, or great ſtate of this world? Becauſe none of them were fit for this office. As no man was worthy to open the booke, and to looſe the ſeales thereof, which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw in the right hand of him that ſate vpon the throne, but onely the Lyon which is of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the roote of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as it is in <hi>Reu.</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was found fit for this office, whether in the heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, ſaue Ieſus Chriſt our ſweete Sauiour, and the bleſſed Sonne of God; and therefore God his Father did make choiſe of him before all others. But why was he fitteſt for this office, may you further ſay? For two cauſes, the one is in regard of his Perſon; the other of his qualities belonging vnto his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For his Perſon, becauſe he is not onely man, as many others are, but alſo God, as none elſe beſides him is, and thereby is made able to weald ſuch a great &amp; mighty kingdome as he hath. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is impoſſible that he ſhould rule his people according to his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:173667:59"/>will, and ſubdue his enimies, to make them his footſtoole, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that they are Principallities and powers, and the greateſt Potentates of this world. For what man or Angell is able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome all the diuels in hell ruſhing vpon him at once together? and to withſtand the whole army of mankind, aſſaulting him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, with their whole power and force? Surely none: he muſt be a God that muſt doe it. And therefore was Chriſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for this purpoſe, who is a God, as well as man, for his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities belonging vnto his Perſon, becauſe he is indued with moſt ſingular giftes and graces fit for gouernement. <hi>Iethro</hi> in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to <hi>Moſes,</hi> required but foure things in a Gouernour, namely, courage, the feare of God, true dealing, and the hating of couetouſneſſe, as we may ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> 1 S 21. But here in Chriſt (the chiefe gouernour of all) we ſhall finde as many more; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe foure, you ſhall haue in him foure more, namely, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, diligence, bounty, and loue. So that in number there are eight. The firſt is courage, for he feares no man, as being the Lord of Lords, &amp; the God of Gods, according to his name, which is written on his garment and thighs, in <hi>Reu.</hi> 19.16. The ſecond is the feare of God, for he reuerenced his Father, and was obedient vnto him, euen vnto the very death of the croſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. The third is iuſtice or true dealing, for <hi>the Scepter of his kingdome, is a Scepter of righteouſneſſe, and he himſelfe is one louing righteouſneſſe, and hating iniquity,</hi> Heb. 8.1.9. The fourth is, hating couetouſneſſe, for he neuer receiued any bribes or recompence for all the cures he did, but <hi>he became poore, that he might make vs rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. The fift is wiſdome, for <hi>in him are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſedome and knowledge. Col.</hi> 2.3. The ſixt is diligence, for he was ſo painefull, that he trauelled from place to place to doe good, and left his owne foode to go about his Fathers buſineſſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.34 And he is brought in by <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Reuelations, Chapter</hi> 1.13 ſtanding in the midſt of the ſeuen Candleſtickes (which are the ſeuen Churches) &amp; there buſily occupied in gouerning them, as a man is, when his garment is about him, and truſt vp with ſome girdle, that it may not trouble or hinder him in the execution of his buſineſſe. The ſeuenth is, bountifulneſſe or liberality, for he doth not impoueriſh his ſubiects, by exacting of them grieuous
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173667:59"/>ſubſidies and taxes, but he doth greatly enrich them, by beſtowing large giftes and benefites vpon them. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.7.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The laſt is, loue or mercy, for he doth beare that kind affection towards his people, that all their miſeries doe touch him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. and for to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good he was content to die for them, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.2.25. Where all theſe things do concurre &amp; meet together, there is a party well qualified for gouernement. A man may be couragious, yet not fearing God; if fearing God, yet not dealing truely; if dealing truely, yet not hating couetouſneſſe; if hating couetouſneſſe, yet not wiſe; if wiſe, yet not diligent; if diligent, yet not boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull; if bountifull, yet not louing; if louing, yet not couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But where ſhall all theſe be found together? Surely in none, but in Chriſt Ieſus: for in him they are in the higheſt degree of perfection, and therefore did the Lord make choice of him before all others to goe in and out before his people, and to be the Head or gouernour of his Church.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt take heed of ſome abuſes,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> we muſt not collect from hence, either that Chriſt is inferiour to his Father, or that he was made King as he was God; for he is equall with his Father in glory &amp; Maieſty touching his diuine nature or God-head, as the Apoſtle doth ſhew in the beginning of his 2. chap. to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> True it is, that he is inferiour to his Father in reſpect of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and as he is man; but not otherwiſe as he is God, &amp; of the ſame ſubſtance or being, which he hath together with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all eternity. Againe, whereas he is made King, this is done in reſpect of both his natures together, as he is God-man, and Man-God; and not ſimply in reſpect of one of them alone; for ſo to affirme of either of them, were abſurd, if not blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>But leauing the abuſes, the true vſes are theſe. Firſt, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may learne to reuerence Chriſt the more, becauſe he is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in his throne by his Father, For if <hi>Dauid</hi> were pricked in heart onely for cutting of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, who was a wicked man, and his deadly enimy too, becauſe he was the Lords annoynted; with what reuerence and care ſhould we carry our ſelues towards Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, who is holineſſe and righteouſneſſe it ſelfe, and one that loues vs well? ſeeing the Lord hath annoynted
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:173667:60"/>him, and made him to be our King. But alas, our carriage is ſuch towards him, as if he had vſurped this place vnto himſelfe by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or were ſet vp in his throne by ſome created authority: but let vs looke to ourſelues, and amend this our fault.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place here we may learne, that ſeeing God hath ſet vp his Sonne in his kingdome, he will ſtill defend him and aide him in the ſame, as alſo bring fearefull iudgments vpon all ſuch as ſhal go about to reſiſt him. And this is the chiefeſt end wherefore this ſentence is here alleadged, and therefore let all men take heed what they do; and let all thoſe know alſo who are in lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that ſo long as they carry themſelues worthy of their places, the Lord will alwaies ſtand about them for their defence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as here he did about his Sonne Chriſt, and bleſſed <hi>Dauid,</hi> the King.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, here we may learne by the example of Chriſt, that it is not good to run into a calling, but to ſtay vntill the Lord doth place vs in the ſame, A great complaint is made in <hi>Ieremy</hi> by the Lord againſt men in this reſpect, that they did run before that he did ſend them, as we may ſee at large in the 23. chapter of <hi>Ieremy.</hi> But beware we that we doe not the like. For ſhall Chriſt that had the Spirit of God without all meaſure, ſtay and waite his Fathers leaſure? and ſhall we mortall and ſinnefull creatures, who haue not the Spirit almoſt in any meaſure, yet runne and goe before our commiſſion is drawne out and ſealed by the Almighty? More things might be ſpoken vpon theſe matters, but let theſe ſhort ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations miniſter an occaſion vnto you, to contemplate more at large vpon theſe points.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former verſes mention was made of God the Father, whoſe maieſtie and power was excellently ſet out, for the confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſuch wicked aduerſaries, as did riſe vp againſt him. But now theſe verſes do intreate of God the Sonne, who is alſo moſt liuely deſcribed in the ſame, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inuincible power and maieſtie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſufficient to ouerthrow all ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance as is made againſt him. And that his enimies might be daunted the more, as his friends receiue the greater ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, he comes in himſelfe ſpeaking and vttering his voyce vnto them, declaring plainely amongſt them all, what is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry decree and ordinance of God his Father concerning him and his kingdome; the ſumme and ſubſtance whereof he tels them is this: The Lord, the great God of heauen, who hath created all things, and who doth continually preſerue the ſame, he, euen he, ſayd to me, <hi>Thou art my ſonne,</hi> yea my naturall and onely ſonne, moſt deare and precious vnto me. Thy workes, which thou doeſt continually, in working ſtrange and admirable miracles do ſhew, that I haue begotten thee: but chiefly that day is an argument
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:173667:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>thereof vnto all the world, wherein thou didſt ariſe from the graue, and returne againe from death vnto life. And becauſe thou art ſo neare vnto me, and one on whom I haue ſet my whole delight and pleaſure, aske of me, what thou wilt, and thou ſhalt haue it, I will not ſay, to the halfe of my kingdome, but to all my kingdome: if thou ſhalt aske the whole, I will beſtow it vpon thee; yea I will giue thee all power both in heauen and in earth, and thou ſhalt reigne, not in a ſmall compaſſe alone, but in a moſt ſpacious and large circuite, euen throughout all the world from the one end thereof vnto the other. And whereas there are many rebels and traytors, that do daily riſe vp againſt thee, thou ſhalt not take pity and compaſſion vpon them to forgiue them, but thou ſhalt puniſh them throughly according to their deſerts; with thy ſcepter, or mace of iron, wherewith thou art armed, thou ſhalt deſtroy them. And herein deale thou with them, as the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth with his veſſell; as he doth daſh that all to peeces, when it is once broken, and ſeruiceable for no vſe; ſo do thou ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them, that they may lie ſtill in their miſeries, and neuer haue any hope to recouer themſelues againe, or to repaire ſuch ruinous breaches as thou doſt bring vpon them. Thus runneth the paraphraſe of this place. Wherein you haue nothing elſe to remember in ſumme,

               </label> but a deſcription of Ieſus Chriſt, the ſecond perſon in the Godhead, who is our ſweet Sauiour, and bleſſed King. In which deſcription obſerue two things. The firſt is the perſon, that doth publiſh the deſcription. The other is the parts, wherein this deſcription doth ſtand.</p>
            <p>The perſon that doth publiſh the deſcription, is Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>I will declare the decree,</hi> or rather, as it is in the Hebrew text, <hi>I will ſpeake or declure according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and ordinance, El hhok.</hi> There are certaine decrees and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances eſtabliſhed by God touching the perſon of Chriſt and his gouernment: Now according to theſe will Chriſt ſpeake, and not otherwiſe. You muſt not here conceiue that ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is brought in ſpeaking, but that it is Chriſt himſelfe, and none elſe but he. True it is, that <hi>Dauid</hi> did vtter them as he was a type and figure of Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelfe as he was the body and truth, and ſo the words are properly and in truth it ſelfe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:173667:61"/>vnto him. Behold, he takes vpon him (as it were) the part of a faithfull Prophet, to make knowne his Fathers will vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, in reſpect of himſelfe, and his waies. I beſeech you, marke diligently how he doth it. It is not according to his owne fanſie (as we often ſpeake,) but it is according to his Fathers owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and appointment, without all deceipt or fraudulent dealing whatſoeuer; there is no adding, nor detracting, no chopping or changing found in him, but all things are faithfully deliuered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth it ſelfe. A worthy thing to be thought often on, and euermore to be had in good remembrance by all ſorts of perſons, but chiefly by the Miniſters of the Word, who ought to be faithfull in their offices, as Chriſt was in his; and not to make merchandiſe of the word of God, but as of ſinceritie, &amp; as of God in the ſight of God, to ſpeake in Chriſt Ieſus; as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſpeake in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter and the laſt verſe thereof. At all times ſhould men looke moſt carefully to this: but much more now in theſe corrupt and rotten dayes of ours, wherein the Lords ordinances are beazelled, and his moſt ſacred Oracles turned vp and downe, like a noſe made of waxe, as pleaſeth the wicked humor of many a ſinfull man: but beware we, beware we of ſuch curſed and ſata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall dealing. If we ſpeake at any time, let vs ſpeake with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, as doth become them, who vtter the words of a mightie God, and according to the truth it ſelfe, and not otherwiſe. So ſhall health be vnto our nauell, and marrow vnto our bones, when others are perplexed with intollerable woe and paine. I might haue made a long diſcourſe of this matter, as being a very fit ſubiect to be ſtood vpon in our licentious times; but thus ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I paſſe it ouer, as intending onely to ſtand moſt vpon thoſe points, which are moſt intended by the Spirit of God himſelfe, and not to do, as many are wont to do, vpon euery ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to wander abroad from my text in hand.</p>
            <p>Two queſtions here may be moued; the one is, whether Chriſt did thus publiſh the decree and appointment of his Father, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching himſelfe, and his kingdome, as here he doth ſay, he would do. The other is, for what cauſes he would do the ſame, and for what end and purpoſe. Touching the former of theſe two, we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:173667:62"/>find in the ſtory of the Euangeliſts, that he did do it, according to the tenor of the text here in hand. For they do ſhew, how he did conſeſſe and declare abroad, that he was the Sonne of God, that all iudgement was committed vnto him by his Father, that he was a king, that all power was giuen vnto him in heauen and earth, that he was the Meſſiah or Annointed, whereof <hi>Eſay</hi> did ſpeake in the 61. chapter of his Propheſie, and the beginning thereof: that he was the bread that came downe from heauen, and the partie whom his Father had ſealed, for the bringing of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life vnto mankind. Theſe and the like things do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him, as you may ſee by <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 5.6. and 18. chapters thereof. By <hi>Luke</hi> the 4. the 22. and 23. chapters: and by <hi>Math:</hi> 16.21.26. and 27. chapters thereof. Reade theſe places (I pray) at your ley ſure, and acknowledge the truth of this point Now for the other, Chriſt might do it for many cauſes. Firſt, that he might bring men into the greater and more willing ſubiection vnto him, according to the ſpeech of the houſholder in <hi>Math.</hi> 21.37. But laſt of all he ſent vnto them his owne Sonne, ſaying: <hi>They will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence my Sonne.</hi> Secondly, that he might leaue men without all excuſe, and make them vnable to anſwer for themſelues at the day of iudgement, if they did not obey him, and do according to his commandements: according to his owne ſaying in <hi>Iohn,</hi> chapter 15. and verſe 22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken vnto them, they ſhould not haue had ſinne, but now haue they no cloake for their ſinne.</hi> Laſtly, that he might comfort and ſtrengthen them that did relie vpon him, againſt the rage and ſurie of the world, as alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the malice and power of Sathan himſelfe, according to that which is in <hi>Iohn,</hi> chapter 16. verſe 33. <hi>Theſe things haue I ſpoken vnto you, that in me ye might haue peace, in the world ye ſhall haue affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but be of a good comfort, I haue ouercome the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing thus in few words anſwered theſe queſtions, which tend to the clearing of the text, and the confirmation of that truth, which is included therein; let vs now come to the maine doctrine of the place. And that in few words ſtandeth thus, namely, that it is the part and duty of men in authority, to ſtand vpon ſuch gifts and callings as God hath beſtowed vpon them, according vnto the example of Chriſt here. For as he did the ſame, ſo muſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173667:62"/>we do it, by vertue of his commandement in <hi>Math.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke on you, and learne of me for I am meeke and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt vnto your ſoules.</hi> So did <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he came vnto the children of Iſrael, to deliuer them out of their bondage, and ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King of Aegypt to craue leaue for a free paſſage for them. For he did not onely make it knowne vnto them all, how God had called him to this worke and buſineſſe by word of mouth alone, declaring what matters had paſſed betwixt him and God; but alſo by workes and deeds, doing ſtrange and admirable miracles daily in their ſight, as we may ſee at large in <hi>Exodus</hi> from the latter end of the fourth chapter thereof, and ſo forward for many chapters together. So did <hi>Dauid,</hi> when <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall</hi> his wife did mocke him, for dauncing in a linnen Ephod before the Arke of the Lord. <hi>It was</hi> (ſaith he in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.21. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, which choſe me rather then thy father</hi> (for ſhe was <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter) <hi>and all his houſe, and commanded me to be ruler ouer the people of the Lord, euen ouer Iſrael, and therefore will I play before the Lord.</hi> So did <hi>Amos,</hi> when <hi>Amaſiah</hi> the Prieſt of Bethell went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to perſwade him to flie away out of the land of Iſrael vnto the land of Iudah, and there to eate his bread, and to propheſie, but not to propheſie any more at Bethell, where was the kings chappell, and the kings court. Then anſwered <hi>Amos</hi> and ſayd to <hi>Amaſia, I was no Prophet, neither was I a Prophets ſonne, but I was a heardman, and a gatherer of wild figges; and the Lord tooke me, as I followed the flocke, and the Lord ſaid vnto me, God, propheſie vnto my people Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein you ſee he doth ſtand ſtoutly vpon his calling, and doth preſſe it well to ſtop ſuch a caytifes mouth, as that <hi>Amaziah</hi> was. This is in the 7. chapter of <hi>Amos</hi> his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and the 12. verſe thereof, with ſome others following. So in a word did all the Prophets from time to time, as is apparant in their propheſies.</p>
            <p>This was a common phraſe or ſtile with them: <hi>The burden of the Lord,</hi> or, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoasts:</hi> or, <hi>The word of the Lord came to me.</hi> As <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith: <hi>The words of the Lord that came to</hi> Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>the Prophet,</hi> in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 47.1. As <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith, <hi>The word of the Lord that came vnto</hi> Hoſea <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Beeri, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.1. As <hi>Ioel</hi> ſaith, <hi>The word of the Lord that came to</hi> Ioel <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Pethuel. <hi>Io.</hi> 1.1.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:173667:63"/>As <hi>Ionah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The word of the Lord came alſo to</hi> Ionah <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Amittai, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1.1. And as <hi>Micha</hi> ſaith (to omit the reſt) <hi>The word of the Lord, that came to</hi> Micha <hi>the Moraſhite.</hi> But in the new Teſtament <hi>Paul</hi> is very frequent in this matter: he doth preſſe his calling oftentimes, and ſtandeth very ſtoutly vpon the ſame, to the defiance of all his enimies, &amp; to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of all ſuch as did cleaue faſt vnto Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; ſuch doctrine, as he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vnto them in his name. But amongſt all other places I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto you at this time onely three: the firſt is in the 26 <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, where he did anſwere for himſelfe before <hi>Agrippa</hi> the King. The ſecond is in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and eleauenth <hi>Chapter,</hi> wherein he doth make a compariſon betwixt himſelfe and other Apoſtles, and doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre himſelfe before them all. The third is in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians</hi> and the beginning thereof; where he proues, that his doctrine, which he had taught the <hi>Galathians,</hi> was not humane, but diuine, he being taught the ſame by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt, who called him immediately from heauen to be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and ſo had his office not from man, but from God, as alſo his Goſpell, or the doctrine which he taught them. Thus you ſee good men from time to time, haue ſtood vpon their places and callings.</p>
            <p>And the reaſons alſo wherefore men ſhould do it, are theſe. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> Firſt, that none through ignorance might contemne them, or ſet light by their callings, but haue them in good veneration according to their worth and excellency. A man may paſſe by a king without any reuerence done vnto him, if he know him not; &amp; the country peaſant (we know) doth trample many an wholeſome herbe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, (which the ſkilfull Apothecary doth gather vp, and make good reckoning of) becauſe he knowes not the vertues and medicinable vſes thereof, as the Apothecary doth. And ſo may men be deſpiſed, and their callings be paſſed ouer without due reuerence and obedience yeelded vnto them by others, vnleſſe they know what they be, and wherehence they haue their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; &amp; therefore it is good that the ſame ſhould be made knowne vnto them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that all perſons may be left without excuſe, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:173667:63"/>haue their mouths ſtopped, if they ſhall rebell and diſobey; for then they cannot pleade ignorance, and ſay, We knew not that they came from God, or had lawfull authority committed vnto their charge, to doe thoſe things which they tooke vpon them for to do. As God doth make himſelfe knowne by the viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the world, to leaue all mankind without all excuſe, which will not feare and worſhip him: ſo the ſame God will haue men to goe in his name vnto others, and to make knowne their authority and callings, that if they will not obey, they may be left tongue-tide (as we ſay) and without any anſwere for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; as we may ſee in <hi>Ezechiel, Chapter</hi> 2. <hi>verſes</hi> 4.5.6. <hi>Say vnto them: Thus ſaith the Lord God; but ſurely they will not heare, neither indeed will they ceaſſe, for they are a rebellious houſe; yet ſhall they know that there hath bene a Prophet among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that they might approue and iuſtifie themſelues in their waies, and ſtoppe the malignant tongues of their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who are ready wrongfully to accuſe them, as if they vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their places, and did things without lawfull authority from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue. For as <hi>Zidikijah</hi> ſmote the Prophet <hi>Michaiah</hi> on the cheeke, and ſaid, <hi>When went the Spirit of the Lord from me, to speake vnto thee?</hi> as it is in 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22.24. ſo from time to time doe many ariſe vp to impeach the credit of thoſe whom God hath raiſed vp, and to make the world beleeue, that the Lord did neuer beſtow thoſe places of dignity vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they do challenge vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For as <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles together with the Prophets and others, found this oftentimes too true (as we ſay) in regard of themſelues: ſo <hi>Iude</hi> doth ſhew in his Epiſtle and eighth verſe thereof, that there are many wicked <hi>dreamers,</hi> that doe <hi>despiſe gouernment, and speake euill of them that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, that they might put courage into their owne hearts, and with due care and conſcience goe about the workes of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, not fearing what man can do againſt them, but looking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vpon God, who placed them in their roomes, and who will neuer faile them, vnleſſe they be wanting vnto themſelues therein. For as the Spirit of God came down vpon <hi>Cornelius</hi> &amp; his friends whiles <hi>Peter</hi> was ſpeaking vnto them, as it is in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. ſo
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:173667:64"/>whiles they doe meditate vpon their places, and are preſſing the ſame vnto others in a zeale towards God, and in a care to do them good, a certaine heauenly courage, and boldneſſe from aboue comes down into their ſoules, whereby they are made more ſtout and valiant, then euer they were before, and doe become in this reſpect like vnto the fire, when it is blowne with the bellowes, that doth burne more and more. So that here are foure reaſons to mooue men to reſpect their callings, and to ſtand faſt in the defenſe thereof, whereof two of them do concerne others, and the other two themſelues.</p>
            <p>By this we are taught,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> firſt, to examine our ſelues what giftes and callings we haue of God, that ſo we may be able to ſtand vpon them, when any iuſt occaſion is offered vnto vs thereunto: for all men haue not their callings from God. The Lord (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Miniſters of the word) doth complaine in the 23. chapter of the Prophecy of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that many did runne, whom he did neuer ſend; and making mention of Kings in ſome other place, he doth ſay, <hi>that they did reigne, but not by him.</hi> And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daily experience doth teach vs, that many of them do vſurpe that authority to themſelues (as <hi>Athalia</hi> the Queene did, of whom you may reade in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. and 23. <hi>chapters</hi> thereof) whom the Lord did neuer eſtabliſh in their throne by his kind &amp; louing approbation. But here it may be demanded, how a man may know, whether his office or calling be from God or no, that ſo he may ſtand ſtoutly vpon the ſame, and labour with all care &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to diſcharge it in the feare of the Lord? The anſwere is, that ye may know it by foure things. The firſt is by his minde, with the which he did enter into it. The ſecond is by his ability, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is enabled to diſcharge it. The third is by the liking of the people, by whom he is approued for it. And the fourth and laſt is by his ſucceſſe, whereby he doth proſper and do good in it. For if he ſhall finde theſe foure things in himſelfe; firſt that he entred into his calling not with a corrupt minde, as for honour, praiſe, gaine, or the like; but with a ſingle heart &amp; deſire to glorifie God and to doe good to his people. Secondly, that he hath graces and giftes ſufficient for to diſcharge thoſe duties which are required at his hands. Thirdly, that he be approued of the Church or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:173667:64"/>wealth, wherein he doth liue, they outwardly beſtowing this calling vpon him. And laſtly, be aſſiſted from time to time by the gracious hand of the Almighty, to haue good ſucceſſe in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and to proſper therein; doubtleſſe then he hath his calling &amp; office from God himſelfe, and not from man alone.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by this, we are taught to iudge charitably of all ſuch as do ſpeake largely now and then of their owne gifts, and thoſe places wherein the Lord hath ſet them. For here we may ſee, a man may doe it with a good ſoule, and diſcharge but an honeſt &amp; godly dutie in ſo doing it. True it is as <hi>Salomon</hi> doth ſay in <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.2. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine owne mouth, a ſtranger and not thine owne lippes.</hi> For is not ſeemely for a man to praiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but yet a man may ſtand vpon his calling, and publiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad ſuch gifts as the Lord hath beſtowed vpon him. For this is not to praiſe himſelfe, but rather to praiſe the Lord, and to bring honour vnto his name. Yea the caſe may ſo ſtand, as we may ſee by <hi>Pauls</hi> words in the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> of his 2 Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as in other places alſo, that a man may praiſe himſelfe with his owne mouth, and ſet out his giftes and graces to the vttermoſt, and yet be no tranſgreſſor of <hi>Salomons</hi> precept therein. For <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon</hi> there doth meane ſuch a praiſing of our ſelues, wherein we aime chiefly at our owne glory: but there is another praiſing of our ſelues, wherein we haue not ſo much an eye to our ſelues, as vnto the Lord and his honour, and the good of all ſuch as do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto him. Now if any ſhall praiſe himſelfe after this ſort, we are to thinke reuerently of him, and not to cenſure him, as a proud and vaine glorious perſon for it, no more then we do humble and bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> who did the like.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, by this, we are taught, what we our ſelues ſhould do, in theſe wicked and vnbridled daies of ours, wherein many vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons do take vpon them, to condemne vs much, and to lay ſlanderous things to our charge, whereof we are cleare and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. The Browniſts (or Separatiſts, as they call themſelues) to make inſtance in one point alone, do accuſe vs, as if we were no true Church of God here in England, and as if our Miniſters were no Miniſters of God, but rather the Miniſters of Antichriſt, the arch and chiefe enimy of God. But we muſt not let them goe on
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:173667:65"/>thus ſtill, with their vile and ſlandering ſpeeches againſt vs, but diſplay vnto them their abhominations, who do ſo vnchriſtianly, &amp; beyond all the bounds of holy charity, condemne vs: &amp; proue, that we are the Lords owne inheritance, and the people whom he hath choſen vnto himſelfe, to haue his holy name called vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, and that our Miniſters are his true and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and ſuch whom he hath ſent forth, and doth take his delight &amp; pleaſure in. Eaſily might theſe matters be confirmed, if we were to enter into any congreſſe with them about the ſame; but now at this time we haue other matters in hand: yet I will preſſe one argument, and ſo leaue them. It ſtandeth thus: Whereſoeuer the word of God is ſo preached, and the Sacraments ſo celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that by their meanes a true and ſound conuerſion is wrought in the hearts of men towards the Lord Almighty, that they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him aright, and walke with carefull ſoules in the paths of his commandements to bring honour vnto his name, &amp; to attaine bleſſedneſſe for themſelues, there (there I ſay) is the true Church of God, and there alſo are his faithfull and truſty Miniſters. But here in England with vs, the word of God is ſo preached, and the Sacraments ſo celebrated, that by their meanes a true and ſound conuerſion is wrought in the hearts of men towards the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that they do beleeue in him aright, and walke with care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoules in the paths of his commandements to bring honour vnto his name, and to attaine bleſſedneſſe for themſelues. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here in England is the true Church of God, and here alſo are his faithfull and his truſty Miniſters. When they ſhall anſwer this argument, I will frame ſome more for them to worke vpon: but I thinke that will neuer be; for they cannot anſwere, it is ſo ſtrong &amp; inuincible, and a knot ſo hard twiſted, that they cannot by any meanes vnlooſe it.</p>
            <p>Thus farre the publiſhing of Gods decree hath ſtretched it ſelfe. Now let vs come to the parts whereof it doth conſiſt, and they are in number two; the one doth reſpect the perſon of Chriſt, the other his office or kingly power. His perſon in the ſeuenth verſe, and his office or kingly power in the eighth and ninth. For his perſon remember two things; the firſt is, whoſe Son he is: the ſecond, how it is proued, that he is his Sonne. He is the Sonne of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:173667:65"/>God, this is ſet downe in theſe words; <hi>That is, the Lord hath ſaid vnto me, Thou art my Sonne.</hi> For by the name Lord, here, God the Father, the firſt Perſon in the Trinity is vnderſtood: he ſaid vnto Chriſt, <hi>Thou art my Sonne.</hi> He ſaid it alſo vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> as vnto the type and figure, for he was alſo Gods Sonne by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as alſo more chiefly by adoption. But yet this was chiefly ſpoken by God the Father vnto Chriſt, as vnto the body &amp; truth it ſelfe. But how is Chriſt his Son, may you ſay? The anſwer is, not by creation, as all are, nor by adoption as many are; but by nature as none is: whereupon he is called his onely begotten Son oftentimes in the word, &amp; namely in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. where our Sauiour doth tell vs, that <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Son, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life.</hi> So that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of this place we may learne this doctrine,

               </label> that Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour and redeemer, is not a bare &amp; meere man as we are, but he is alſo God, as being the true and naturall Sonne of the Almighty. This the Lord himſelfe did confeſſe of him oftentimes: ſaying, <hi>This is my wel-beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> as it is in <hi>Math.</hi> 3.17. and <hi>Math.</hi> 17.5. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him: doth ſay, <hi>That he is a God ouer all, to be bleſſed for euer,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo writing his ſtory, doth aſcribe as much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in the entrance thereof: ſaying, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God.</hi> The Scripture is full of many teſtimonies in this behalfe, but I wil paſſe them all ouer, as knowing that this is an article of your faith, and a matter nothing doubted of amongſt you. For I do perſwade my ſelfe, that all of vs doe hold and beleeue that Chriſt is God, and the naturall and onely begotten Sonne of the Almighty. But yet peraduenture you ſee not clearely the reaſons, why he is ſuch an one, &amp; therfore I will ſhortly touch them, and lay them downe before your view and conſideration. In number they are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> that he might be able to vndergoe the wrath of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, who was offended with man for his ſin, &amp; to beare that intollerable burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he ſhould lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for mans tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; which would cruſh all the creatures in the world to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it being infinite like vnto him, from whom it did proceede, who was infinitely offended with vs for our offences. For there
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:173667:66"/>muſt be alwaies a proportion betweene the ſinne of man, and the puniſhment of his ſinne, elſe iuſtice hath not her full ſtroake and working.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he might be able in mans nature and name to fulfill the whole law of God, and euery iot and point thereof, and not to faile in any; that ſo we thereby might liue, and haue a free paſſage into heauen, to reigne with God there in happineſſe for euer, according to the tenor of the law, <hi>Do this, and thou ſhalt liue.</hi> For no mortall man is able to doe this. <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.22.) <hi>there is no iuſt man in the earth, that doeth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> And as <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſay: <hi>If we ſay, that we haue no ſinne, we deceiue our ſelues, and there is no truth in vs.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.8. So <hi>Iames</hi> doth ſay, that <hi>in many things we ſinne all. Iam.</hi> 3.2. including him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all the faithfull whatſoeuer within the compaſſe of this his ſpeech.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that he might be able to beſtow vertue &amp; worthineſſe enough vpon his ſhort ſufferings and obedience, that they might be auaileable for the ſaluation of all the elect, and be as much in the acceptation of God, as if the elect themſelues had ſuffered in their owne perſons eternally, and had bene obedient vnto the Almighty in all points of his law for euermore.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that he might be able to ouermatch the diuell and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduerſaries, that are againſt vs, to deliuer vs out of their hands, being deliuered to preſerue vs from them, while we are here in this world; and being preſerued to beſtow vpon vs eternall life in the world to come, when we ſhall reigne with him in happineſſe, for euermore. For no creature can doe theſe things but God himſelfe alone. And therfore it was neceſſary, that the Sauiour of the world ſhould be God, as well as man.</p>
            <p>The conſideration whereof may teach vs,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> firſt and foremoſt to condemne all ſuch heretiques, as doe deny his God-head, and ſay, that he is not the eternall Sonne of the Lord, whether they be <hi>Samoſatenians,</hi> affirming him to be a bare man alone; or <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Seruetians,</hi> gaineſaying his coeſſentiall and coeternall deity; or <hi>Lucians, Porphyrians, Atheiſts,</hi> or whatſoeuer elſe, that doe withſtand his diuine nature, and will not haue him in any caſe to be a God.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:173667:66"/>
            <p> Secondly, out of it we may learne, to haue Chriſt in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and veneration, adoring and worſhipping him, as well as the Father, and the holy Spirit; conſidering that he is God, as well as they. Though we muſt not worſhip him, in regard of his humane nature, yet we muſt do it in regard of his godhead, or diuine nature. For in that reſpect all reuerence and honour muſt be yeelded vnto him, and euery knee muſt bow vnto him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and in earth. The very Angels themſelues are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from this ſeruice, but they muſt performe it vnto him, as well as others, according to that which is quoted by the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. when he ſaith, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> Children of Noblemen and Princes heires here in this world are had in great account, and reputation with all men, they are the very ſpeech and wonder of the world, and euery man muſt bow and becke to them. But yet alas, Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, who is the Sonne of God, and the heire of all the world, yea God himſelfe, is little regarded by moſt; for there are few that do talke of him, and fewer that do bow and becke to him, as they ought to do. The Lord be mercifull vnto vs in this reſpect, and make vs better, that ſo hereafter we may honour him, as it doth become vs, and ſerue him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, all the dayes of our liues.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, out of it we may obſerue, that ſeeing he is God, he is able to reuenge his quarrell vpon all thoſe that do reſiſt him, and not onely to defend thoſe that do depend vpon him, but alſo to reward them with liberall gifts for their ſeruice, and to do them good for euermore, ſo that they need not to feare any thing for this world, or the world to come. A thing alwayes to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by vs, leſt either we lift vp our ſelues againſt him, or taking his part ſhould faint, through the manifold afflictions, that do happen vnto vs for his ſake.</p>
            <p>As thus we haue heard whoſe ſonne Chriſt is, namely Gods, ſo now we muſt marke, how it is proued, that he is Gods ſonne: and that is included in theſe words, <hi>This day haue I begotten thee:</hi> that is, this day or time, wherein thou doeſt riſe from the dead, and returne from death vnto life, haue I manifeſted and declared vnto the world all abroad, that thou art my Sonne, and that I haue
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:173667:67"/>begotten thee. For ſo is this place expounded by <hi>Paul,</hi> euen of the time of Chriſts reſurrection, as we may ſee in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.30.33. So that then there muſt be a diſtinction made betweene genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or begetting it ſelfe, and the manifeſtation of it. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or begetting it ſelfe was from all eternitie, but the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of it was in time, and then chiefly, when Chriſt roſe from the dead. For then was he mightily declared to be the Sonne of God, as the Scripture doth teach vs. But here before we ſtand vpon the proofe it ſelfe, a few things may be obſerued touching the generation, or Gods begetting of his Sonne. For as we are to know, that Chriſt is the Sonne of God, ſo we are to vnderſtand in ſome ſort, how the Father did beget him, whoſe Sonne he is ſaid to be.</p>
            <p>The manner therefore of this generation in few words was this. The Sonne was begotten of the ſubſtance of the Father, not by any fluxe, as when water is deriued from the head of the ſpring to the channell: not by any deciſion, as when a thing is cut in peeces: nor by any propagation, as when a graft is tranſplanted into a new ſtocke: but by an vnſpeakable communication of the whole eſſence or godhead from the Father to the Sonne; in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing whereof the Sonne doth no more diminiſh the maieſtie or godhead of the Father, then the light of one candle doth the light of another, from which it is taken. The time of this generation hath neither beginning, middle, nor end, and therefore it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall before all worlds. Wiſedome in the Prouerbes (which with one conſent of all Diuines is ſaid to be Chriſt) affirmeth, that ſhe was before the world was created, that is, from eternitie. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was made, there was nothing but eternity. <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.24. Here are many things to be wondred at in this generation of the Sonne, and we muſt be warned, not to conceiue it in any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or humane manner. For there is a great difference betweene it, and thoſe generations, which are found here in this world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs that are men. For firſt, in our generations the father is in time before his ſon, and the ſon is after his father: but in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration God the Father and the Sonne are coeternall, and not one before or after the other for time. Secondly, in our genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the father is forth of the ſonne, and the ſonne forth of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:173667:67"/>ſo that they are diſtant in place ſometimes the one from the other many a mile: but in this generation God the Father is in the Sonne, and the Sonne is in the Father, ſo that they are in place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes together. Thirdly, in our generations the ſonne is from his father by propagation: but in this generation the Son is from the Father by communication of ſubſtance, and not by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Finally, in our generations the father doth beget the ſonne by communicating onely his ſeed vnto him: but in this generation God the Father doth beget the Sonne by communicating his whole ſubſtance vnto him. So that here is a fourefold difference to be found betwixt our carnall and this ſpirituall generation, or begetting. And therefore (I beſeech you) do none of you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of it after a groſſe manner, but pray you vnto God for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eyes, that you may behold it. And if any of you cannot conceiue aright of it, wonder at it, as at a deepe myſterie; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, contemne it not, as a thing either falſe or vnfruitfull. And ſo I leaue it, and come to the proofe it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>That is taken (you ſee) from Chriſts reſurrection from the dead. All the miracles that Chriſt did fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, going ſtil beyond the reach and power of man, did declare, that he was the Sonne of God: yet it hath pleaſed the holy Ghoſt, to apply this chiefly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his reſurrection, as being a moſt notable argument to proue the ſame. For being dead, if he had not bene the Sonne of God indeed, he had neuer riſen againe, but had periſhed in death. And in that the Father raiſed him againe to life, he gaue euident wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and teſtimonie, that he was his owne naturall Sonne, and that he had begotten him from all eternitie. And therefore <hi>Paule</hi> doth ſay, that he was mightily declared to be the Sonne of God by the reſurrection from the dead, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. So that thoſe that doubt, whether Chriſt be the Sonne of God, or no, they may be reſolued, if they will but throughly conſider of his reſurrection from the dead. For thus they may reaſon with themſelues: <hi>No creature that is dead and buried, can of himſelfe riſe againe from the graue, and returne from death vnto life, but he that doth this muſt needs be the Sonne of God. But Christ Ieſus was dead and buried, yet he roſe againe from the graue, and returned from death vnto life. Therefore Chriſt Ieſus is no bare creature, but he is a Creator, and the Sonne of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:173667:68"/>liuing God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many things might be here obſerued, and ſtood vpon concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this point, but becauſe they are common matters, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Article of our faith, touching the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, I will paſſe them ouer, and referre them to your owne priuate meditations. Onely noting here by the way, that as God did manifeſt the generation of his naturall Sonne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and did make men ſee, that he had begotten him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his miracles, and chiefly by raiſing him from the dead: ſo he doth continually manifeſt the generation of his adopted ſons, and make them knowne to themſelues, and vnto others, by his holy working in them, and chiefly by his raiſing of them vp from the death of ſinne vnto the life of righteouſneſſe; as we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee by many places of the holy Scripture, but moſt excellently by that which <hi>Iohn</hi> hath written in the third chapter of his firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, the 8.9. and 10. verſes thereof. For there he doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly teach vs, who they be that are borne of God, and how they may be knowne from the children of the Diuell, and that is, by their liues and conuerſations. For as the one of them do commit ſinne, who are of the Diuell, ſo the other of them do not ſinne, who are of God, but they worke righteouſneſſe, and become ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as God their Father is holy: yea, as he doth further ſay, they cannot ſinne, becauſe they are borne of God. So that then, they are not leud and licentious, as others are, but they are ſanctified perſons, and ſuch as do worke out their ſaluation with feare and trembling.</p>
            <p>By this we may ſhortly learne two things; the one is whether we our ſelues be the children of God, or no: the other is, whom of others we are to account for ſuch. For our ſelues, if we flie the corruption, which is in the world through luſt, and giue all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence thereunto, ioyning moreouer vertue with our faith, and with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience godlineſſe, and with godlineſſe brotherly kindneſſe, and with brotherly kindneſſe loue: we may aſſure our owne ſoules, that we are the children of God, and that he hath begotten vs vnto life eternall, as <hi>Peter</hi> doth well declare in the firſt chapter of his ſecond Epiſtle, the 10.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:173667:68"/>and 11. verſes thereof. For others, we are to take them onely for the children of God, who walke not according to the fleſh, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, and do become new creatures, performing the ſame holy duties with vs, whereof mention was made (out of <hi>Peter</hi>) laſt of all. But if either we our ſelues or others faile herein, leading wicked or looſe liues, we may tremble and feare; but we muſt not challenge this prerogatiue vnto our ſelues, to be called the ſonnes of God; nor giue it vnto others, that are vnworthy of the ſame. For as God is holy, ſo are all thoſe holy, who are borne of him; but as for the reſt who are wicked and naught, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Diuell, who was a ſinner from the beginning, as <hi>Iohn</hi> doth teach vs in the place before alleaged. Wherefore looke to your ſelues, that you may be boly and righteous, riſing from the death of ſinne, vnto the life of righteouſneſſe, that thereby you may be aſſured, that God is your father, and that he hath begotten you: and beware alſo what title and appellation you giue vnto others, that none may be wronged, but euery one may haue that which doth of right belong vnto him.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus ſpoken of the perſon of Chriſt, or his ſonne-ſhip: now we are to ſpeake of his office, or princely kingdome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is ſet downe firſt the largeneſſe of it in the 8. verſe; then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the inuincible power of it in the 9. verſe. In handling theſe things I will be as briefe as I can. In deſcribing the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, there is included a duty which he muſt performe, namely prayer; then the fruit of it, which is a great and large gift. I will ioyne both theſe together for breuities ſake. <hi>Aske of me,</hi> ſaith the text; theſe are the words of God the Father, inuiting <hi>Dauid</hi> or Chriſt, to aske ſomewhat of him, and enioyning them a certaine duty to performe, if they would haue their kingdomes enlarged. The words following containe the gift it ſelfe, which God would beſtow vpon them, vpon their prayer and petition, which they ſhould make vnto him: <hi>And I will giue thee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> A worthy reward of ſuch a ſmall duty as prayer is, and a gift (as we ſay) moſt worthy of a king. Surely as God is, ſuch is his gift. For as he is great and mighty, ſo is his gift here great and mighty. It is obſerued of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that he gaue to one <hi>Perillus</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:173667:69"/>for the marriage of his daughter fiftie talents; and when <hi>Perillus</hi> told him, that it was too much by halfe, he anſwered him, and ſayd, If halfe be enough for thee to take, yet it is not enough for me to giue. And in like manner, when he had giuen vnto a poore Aegyptian a rich and populous citie, and the Aegyptian ſtood all aſtoniſhed at it, ſuppoſing that he had mocked him, <hi>Take</hi> (quoth he to him) <hi>that which I giue thee: for if thou art</hi> Bias <hi>that demandeſt, I am</hi> Alexander <hi>that giueth.</hi> Thus he would giue gifts according to his owne ability and power. So, euen ſo, doth the Lord our God deale here: he doth beſtow his gifts according to his owne ability and power. Though halfe a kingdome be a great gift, yet a whole kingdome is but a ſmall gift with him. <hi>Dauid</hi> and Chriſt muſt haue more of him then that. For <hi>Dauid</hi> (who was but the figure and type of Chriſt) had of him not onely the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael and Iudah, but all the heathen alſo, that were round about him, as the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites, Aramites, Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims, Amalekites,</hi> and diuerſe others; all which were in ſubiection, and became tributaries to him, as may be ſeene by the ſecond booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and namely by the 8. chapter thereof. But as for Chriſt (who was the body and truth) he had ſpacious and large dominions of him indeed. For he beſtowed vpon him not onely one kingdome or two alone, but all the kingdomes of the world from one end thereof vnto the other; as the Apoſtle doth at large declare in his 1. <hi>chap.</hi> to the <hi>Ephe.</hi> &amp; in his 2. <hi>chap.</hi> to the <hi>Phil.</hi> Wherupon Chriſt himſelfe ſpake vnto his Diſciples, ſaying; <hi>All power is giuen vnto me in heauen &amp; earth; Go therfore and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the name of the Father, the Son, &amp; the holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerue all things, whatſoeuer I haue commanded you,</hi> as it is in <hi>Math</hi> 28.18.19.20. Here I might ſtand vpon the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſts kingdome, and gather ſome good obſeruations out of the vniuerſality thereof; as to ſhew, that whereſoeuer we liue or be, yet we are vnder his dominion, and are there to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him; and that if we do once offend him, and play a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous part with him, there is no place of ſafetie for vs to flie vnto, to eſcape his power and hand, as who doth reigne throughout all the world, and not in ſome places alone, as kings here vpon the earth do; amongſt whom malefactors (yea moſt vile and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:173667:69"/>traytors) do eſcape oftentimes death and other puniſhments according to their juſt deſerts, becauſe they ſhift out of one mans kingdome into another. But I will paſſe them ouer to your owne conſiderations, &amp; come to more neceſlary points for our learning.</p>
            <p>A duty, you ſee here, is enioyned vpon Chriſt, that he muſt pray to his Father for his kingdome, and aske the ſame of him. Againe a large promiſe is made vnto him, that if he ſhall ſo do, he ſhall haue an ample one indeed, euen ſuch an one, as ſhall reach from one end of the world vnto the other. Vpon both theſe brances, a man might ſeuerally inſiſt and ſtand, but (as I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before) I will conioyne them both together, that of two works I may (for ſhortneſſe ſake) make but one. Wherefore the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (which is to be collected out of them both together) is this,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that men muſt pray to God for benefits, and that by praying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, they ſhall obtaine them. <hi>Aske</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt) <hi>and it ſhall be giuen you, ſeeke and ye ſhall find, knocke and it ſhall be opened vnto you. For whoſoeuer asketh receiueth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened,</hi> as it is in <hi>Math.</hi> 7.7.8. Likewiſe <hi>Iames</hi> doth ſay (making inſtance in one particular, which is wiſedome) <hi>If any of you lacke wiſedome, let him aske of God, which giueth vnto all men liberally, and reproacheth no man; and it ſhall be giuen him,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Iames</hi> 1.5. And whereas man will not regard vs in the time of need, but then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to forſake vs, when once we come into trouble and miſerie, though in the time of our proſperitie he made much of vs, and was readie to do vs what good he could: it is not ſo with God. For if we ſhall pray vnto him in the midſt of all our calamities, he will harken vnto vs, and become moſt gracious and fauourable vnto vs, to deliuer vs out of them all, as he himſelfe doth teach vs in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 50.15. ſaying, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, ſo will I deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> By all which places (you ſee) it is a moſt cleare and euident doctrine, that we muſt both pray to God, and that by our prayers vnto him, we ſhall receiue fauors at his hands.</p>

               </label> becauſe by prayers we do honour him moſt, and bring great glory to his name, in that we do acknowledge him to be the giuer of all things,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:173667:70"/>and one, on whom our whole life, and all that we haue, do depend. By prayers we ſhall receiue benefites of him, becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed prayers as an ordinarie meanes and ſecond cauſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey his benefites oner vnto vs. For as he hath appointed the end of all things, ſo he hath appointed alſo in the ſame decree of his, the meanes which are fit to bring them to the ſame end. And therefore ſeeing prayer is one of the chiefe and principall meanes, which he hath ordained for the powring downe of his gifts and graces vpon mankind, it is no maruell, though by praying vnto him, men do receiue from time to time moſt rare and excellent bleſſings from him.</p>
            <p>Learne we then from hence theſe points.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> Firſt, that they are worthy of blame, who do neglect prayer, and do not powre out their ſoules from time to time vnto the Almightie, as they ought to do. It is our part to pray continually, as the Apoſtle doth teach vs in 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. and to watch thereunto with all perſeuerance, and ſupplication for all Saints, as it is in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. But yet alas, we do it too ſeldome, and ſome almoſt neuer in all their liues. But let vs amend this our fault, and grow better in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the reaſon, why many do receiue few or no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits at the hands of God, is this, not becauſe his hand is ſhortned it and vnable to do them good, but becauſe they do not pray vnto him, and aske for benefites of him. <hi>Ye luſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iames</hi>) <hi>and haue not; ye enuie and haue indignation, and cannot obtaine; ye fight and warre and get nothing, becauſe ye aske not.</hi> Iames 4.2. If you ſay, that you aske and receiue not, I will anſwer you with the ſame Apoſtle, and in the ſame place, that the cauſe thereof is, <hi>becauſe ye aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,</hi> as doth follow there in the next verſe. Either the thing which you craue is not lawfull and expedient, or your mind in crauing is not earneſt, or Chriſt is not made the Mediator, or the end is not good, or the prayer is not continuall, or faith laſtly is not there to preſent it. If theſe or any of theſe faile or be wanting, it is no maruell though our prayer receiue the repulſe. But let them all concurre and meete together, as they ought to do, then ſhall we obtaine of God whatſoeuer we will ourſelues.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that prayer is a moſt fruitfull thing, and ſuch a meanes, as it brings with it vnto vs the great and wonderfull gifts of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:173667:70"/>Almightie. As it will ſtay the Lord from ſmiting, euen then, when his hand is vpto lay on, (as we may ſee at large in the beginning of the 32. chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> prayer pacified the Lord, and turned his wrath away from the Iſraelites, ſo that they were not conſumed according to their deſers:) ſo it doth pull downe his mercies and benefits in great abundance vpon vs. For looke what we do deſire, the Lord is ready to graunt vnto vs, yea he doth grant more vnto vs oftentimes, then we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. As for example, <hi>Zaccheus</hi> deſired onely to ſee Chriſt; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides that, Chriſt called him by his name, and offered his owne ſelfe vnto him for his ſaluation, as it is in the beginning of the 19 chapter according to Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell The ſicke of the palſie deſired onely the health of his body, but he obtained alſo the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of his ſinnes, as appeareth in the beginning of the ninth chapter according to S. <hi>Mathew. Salomon</hi> deſired only wiſedome, that he might know how to rule his people, and to go in and out before them, but as God did beſtow that vpon him, ſo he did giue him alſo riches and honor, ſo that among the kings there was none like him all his daies, as it is euident in 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 3 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Iacob</hi> deſired onely food and apparell, when he went from his parents to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> to fetch him a wife amongſt his owne kindred; but the Lord made him a great rich man, and cauſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home againe, with abundance of wealth and goods, as it is ſtoried of him in the booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> in chapter 28.30. and 33. Well therefore might <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that he that is Lord ouer all, is rich vnto all that call on him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. And well alſo might <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay, that the Lord is neare vnto all that call vpon him, yea that call vpon him in truth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.18. And as for the Lords dealing towards himſelfe, he doth vtter it in theſe words: <hi>Thou haſt giuen him his hearts deſire, and haſt not denied him the requeſt of his lippes. For thou didſt preuent him with liberall bleſſings, and didſt ſet a crowne of pure gold vpon his head; he asked life of thee, and thou gaueſt him a long life for euer and euer.</hi> Pſal. 21.20. &amp;c. I pray, thinke deeply on theſe things, and let them encourage our hearts to pray ſtill. If we were ſure, that the kings Maieſtie would admit vs alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence, and grant vnto vs whatſoeuer we ſhould deſire of him, I doubt not but that we ſhould be forward, yea too forward,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:173667:71"/>to go vnto him often with our ſuites, to haue benefits and high promotions from him. But ſuch a king we haue here (who is the king of kings) and ſhall not we then commence our ſuites conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vnto him? and waite at the gates of his grace with our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications a ready drawne in our hands to deliuer them vnto him at his coming forth? Kingdomes (we ſay) go not a begging, yet the Catholicke and vninerſall kingdome of Chriſt (which is the greateſt of all) was obtained by begging. For he had it onely for the asking. If beggers ſpeed ſo well (we ſay againe) we our ſelues will begge. To conclude therefore this point, let vs do it then, and runne ſtill to God begging for benefits, and doubt we not, but we ſhall receiue them, and ſuch large ones too, as none can be larger. For as God is greater then all, ſo are his gifes larger then all. Thinke on theſe things for your good; and ſo let vs paſſe from this firſt point, whereby Chriſts kingdome is ſet out, and come to the ſecond, which is the inuincible power thereof. For as his kingdome is large reaching ouer all the world: ſo it is powerfull, being able to beate downe all oppoſition, that is made againſt it. This is ſet downe in the 9. verſe in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt cruſh them with a ſcepter of iron, and breake them in peeces like a potters veſſell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſpeech is allegoricall, being drawne part of it from kings (as mention is made here of a king) who are armed with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and power to puniſh thoſe that do offend, or riſe vp in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt them; in regard whereof ſome ſcepter (noting out the ſame) is wont to be carried before them: and here this ſcepter is ſayd to be of iron, rather then of gold, ſiluer, braſſe, wood, or the like; becauſe iron is the ſtrongeſt and fitteſt to beate downe all things before it: And part of it alſo from potters, who do many times ſo breake their earthen veſſels into peeces, which they do diſlike withall, that they can neuer be ſoudred faſt together againe. By this then is meant, that the enimies muſt be deſtroyed, and that in ſuch a fearefull manner, as that they may neuer be able to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their former eſtate againe, or haue any the leaſt hope left vnto them for the ſame. And marke you here, how God doth enioyne this duty vpon Chriſt his ſonne, and command him for to do it. There are other vſes of the power of Chriſt. For this inuincible
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:173667:71"/>power is granted vnto him as well for the defence and good of his ſubiects, who are loyall and faithfull vnto him, as for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and ouerthrow of his aduerſaries. But yet this latter is onely touched here, becauſe mention was made before onely of his aduerſaries, and nothing was ſpoken of his friends. So that when the Lord doth command him to cruſh and breake them in peeces, he doth not vnderſtand by the word or name of <hi>them,</hi> all the heathen whatſoeuer, which he gaue vnto him for his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor all the ends of the earth, which he beſtowed vpon him for his poſſeſſion; but he meanes onely ſuch rebels as did riſe vp againſt him, which were touched in the three firſt verſes: thoſe he muſt deſtroy, and bring to nothing, but the reſt he was to fauour, and to do good vnto. Looke then how <hi>Dauid</hi> gaue his ſonne <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> a charge (when he lay, as we ſay, vpon his death-bed, and was ready to depart out of this world) touching <hi>Ioab</hi> (that ſlue <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa</hi>) and touching <hi>Shimei</hi> (that curſed him, and threw ſtones at him, when he fled from <hi>Abſolom</hi> his ſonne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring againſt him) that he ſhould not ſuffer their hoare heads to come to the graue in peace; as it is in the beginning of the ſecond chapter of the firſt booke of the Kings: So doth the Lord here giue his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus a charge, touching thoſe as did rebell againſt him, that he ſhould not ſuffer them to liue, but vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſtroy them for euermore, accordingly as they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
            <p>But here two queſtions may be moued, the one is, whether Chriſt did it; the other is, the manner how he did it. For the firſt, it is anſwered in a word, that <hi>He did it,</hi> as was ſhewed before, and therefore not now againe to be ſtood vpon. And as for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the manner was manifold. For ſome of his enimies he doth deſtroy with ſome ſudden and extraordinary death. Others he doth torment with griefes and wounds of ſoule, which are almoſt intollerable, and by the meanes whereof they haue no peace within themſelues, but do lie in continuall deſpaire of their owne ſaluation. Not a few of them are tortured in their bodies by horrible diſeaſes, and made alſo deſolate and poore for wealth, hauing no maintenance to relieue them. Thouſands, and ten thouſands he giues ouer to hardneſſe of heart, that they commit
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:173667:72"/>ſinne with all greedineſſe, and make themſelues fat againſt the day of ſlaughter. But to paſſe all other wayes, whether of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie or the like, which happen vnto them here in this world, that is the wofulleſt way of all, when he throwes them downe into hell, and there doth keepe them in flames of fire, that cannot be quenched, boyling and roſting for euermore. And this all of them ſhall be ſure of, as we may ſee in <hi>Math.</hi> 25.41. when he ſaith vnto them, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the Diuell and his angels.</hi> For as his kingdome is not of this world, ſo commonly are not his puniſhments in this world, but in the world to come, in that hideous, and euer-tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting place.</p>
            <p>As we ſtood not vpon the vniuerſality and largeneſſe of Chriſts kingdome in the former verſe: ſo will not we ſtand now vpon the inuincible power and might of his kingdome in this verſe; neither yet preſſe any further the deſtroying of his enimies ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of therein. Firſt, becauſe mention was made of them before; and ſecondly, becauſe occaſion will be offered to ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of them againe hereafter in the end of this Pſalme.</p>
            <p>Here at this time,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> in that God the Father doth commaund his Sonne to deſtroy his enimies, we may obſerue this doctrine, that malefactors and euill perſons, that do offend, muſt not be ſpared, but muſt be puniſhed, according to their deſerts, and wretched wayes. <hi>Betimes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid) will I destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord,</hi> as it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.8. ſo that he would ſpare none, that were wicked and licentious, and did rebell with an high hand againſt the Lord. <hi>Phineas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was greatly commended for his zeale towards the Lord, when he executed death vpon the adulterer <hi>Zimri</hi> the Iſraelite, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſſe <hi>Cozbi</hi> the Midianite, and did runne them both through with a ſpeare, euen through their belly, as they were in the tent, committing the act of their filthineſſe together, as it is in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The law of the Lord was amongſt the Iſraelites, and in the policy of their gouernment (the equity whereof doth belong to all common wealth, and ſtates of gouernement whatſoeuer, though the bodie of that people be diſſolued, and their policie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:173667:72"/>came to an end) that idolaters, blaſphemers, diſobedient children to their parents, murtherers, adulterers, witches, and other noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners ſhould be put to death, and be cut off from amongſt men, as we may ſee at large in the booke of <hi>Moſes, Exodus, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus, Numbers</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomie:</hi> and as for other faults, there were other puniſhments appointed according to the qualitie of the offence, and the treſpaſſe therein committed. By all which we may ſee, that God had a ſpeciall care from time to time, that ſinne ſhould not go vncontrolled, but be iuſtly puniſhed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of it, either more or leſſe, as it did deſerue. In conſideration whereof, you perceiue, malefactors muſt not be ſpared, but be duly puniſhed for their faults and offences.</p>
            <p>And the reaſons hereof are foure. Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> that the malefactors themſelues, who do offend, may be brought to the ſight of their ſinnes, and to the leauing of them, if it be poſſble: for (as <hi>Salomon</hi> doth ſay in <hi>Prou.</hi> 20.30.) <hi>The blewneſſe of the woundſerueth to purge the euill, and the ſtripes within the bowels of the belly:</hi> or elſe, if they will not amend, that they may be taken away by death, to ſinne to more againſt their owne ſoules, or to pollute the land any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wherein they dwell. And this was the cauſe, wherefore God would haue idolaters to be ſtoned to death, as we may gather from his words in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.7. when he ſaith: <hi>So thou ſhalt take the wicked away from among you.</hi> Secondly, that others may learne by their examples, to take heed of the like offences, leſt they be made partakers of the ſame puniſhments with them. For puniſhments executed vpon ſome are oftentimes great terrors vnto others, and do bridle them from their licentious wayes, as daily experience and all Chronicles of the world do ſhew. But at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member one example alone, and that is of the third Captaine with his fiftie men, ſpoken of in the firſt Chapter of the ſecond booke of the Kings; for he ſo profited by the iudgements that came vpon the two former Captaines with their fiftie men apeece, when fire came downe from heauen and conſumed them all, that he ſubmitted himſelfe to the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> and fell to intreate him for the ſafetie of his life, as it is in the 14. verſe of the ſame Chapter.</p>
            <p>And this was the cauſe, wherefore God would haue the Iudge
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:173667:73"/>to do vnto euery man, as euery man thought to do vnto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we may ſee by his words in <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.20. when he ſaith, <hi>And the reſt ſhall heare this, and feare, and ſhall henceforth commit no more any ſuch wickedneſſe among you.</hi> Thirdly, that the good and innocent may not be corrupted by their company, and bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. For as euill words do corrupt good manners, ſo much more do euill deeds, and bad conuerſation. The life and example of one inceſtuous man was ſufficient to corrupt all <hi>Corinth.</hi> And this was the cauſe, wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> would haue the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to excommunicate that inceſtuous perſon out of their holy fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as we may well collect out of his words in 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.9. when he ſaith, <hi>Purge out therefore the old leauen, that ye may be a new lumpe, as ye are vnleauened. For Chriſt our paſſeouer is ſacrificed for vs.</hi> Laſtly, that the Lords anger, who is offended with their ſinnes and tranſgreſſions, may be appeaſed, and not breake out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all for the ſame. For as the ſinne of man doth pollute the whole land, as the ſtory of the <hi>Cananites</hi> do ſhew, <hi>Leui.</hi> 18.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſet all things out of order, as we may ſee by the ſinne of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that troubled Iſrael, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.18. and by the ſinne of falſe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that troubled the <hi>Galathians, Gal.</hi> 5.10. as alſo by the ſinne of the prodigall ſonne, which put him beſides himſelfe; for he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his ſinne, is ſayd to haue come to himſelfe. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17: So it doth driue the Lord away from him, and from others for his ſake, vntill he be duly puniſhed for his ſinne, as he ought to be; as we may ſee moſt excellently in the ſeuenth chapter of <hi>Ioſuah.</hi> For there we find, that God did leaue Iſrael for a time for <hi>Achans</hi> ſinne, but after he was put to death for the ſame, he did helpe them againe, and gaue them a notable victory ouer their enimies. And this is the cauſe, wherefore the Lord would haue <hi>Moſes</hi> to put the adulterers to death, as we may perceiue by his words in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.4. when he ſayd vnto him, <hi>Take all the heads of the people, and hang them vp before the Lord againſt the Sunne, that the indignation of the Lords wrath may be turned from Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of theſe things thus layd downe,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> we may obſerue many profitable things for our inſtruction. For firſt thereby we may ſee, that ſeeing malefactors muſt be puniſhed, that we muſt not ſtorme nor chafe, if the Magiſtrate and ſuperiour powers inflict
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:173667:73"/>vpon vs puniſhment, after that we haue ſinned againſt the lawes of the Lord our God, and haue tranſgreſſed the good and lawfull ſtatutes of the land. Then, then I ſay, we muſt take all things pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and acknowledge that we haue but our due, and that our gouernours therein do but diſcharge an holy duty, which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie doth require at their hands. Let children and ſeruants (amongſt others) marke this well, that ſo when they are corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and chaſtiſed by their parents and maiſters for their faults, they may poſſeſſe their ſoules with patience, and learne thereby to amend, and not to fall to murmurings, and diſcontentments, as many vngracious children and ſeruants are wont to do. <hi>What praiſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to ſeruants in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.) <hi>is it, if when ye be buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted for your faults, ye take it patiently? but and if when ye do well, ye ſuffer wrong, and take it patiently, this is acceptable to God.</hi> Whereby he ſhewes vs, that this is a neceſſary duty belonging to all that haue offended, quietly and with patient ſoules to beare ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as are layd vpon them for their offences.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by it we may ſee, what Magiſtrates and men of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ought to do, who beare the ſword not in vaine (as <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſpeake in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4) but to take vengeance on him that doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. They muſt not ſee offences committed in the land, but they muſt draw out their ſwords for the puniſhment thereof. <hi>A wiſe king</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Prou</hi> 20.26.) <hi>ſcattereth the wicked, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the wheele to turne ouer them:</hi> His meaning is, that good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and godly Magiſtrates cannot away in any hand with wicked perſons, but they muſt needs roote them out. For vnder the word <hi>wheele</hi> he alludeth to the manner of threſhing vſed among the Iewes in thoſe times. The ſaying is old and true, <hi>Non minor eſt virtus, quàm quaerere, parta tueri, It is as great a vertue to keepe what is gotten, as firſt to get it.</hi> And euen ſo it is as good a duty in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to ſee lawes executed and kept, as at the firſt to make them. And ſince they will not be kept of all without puniſhments, therefore puniſhments are moſt neceſſary. Ill then and wickedly deale they, that haue authority in their hands to cut downe ſinne, and yet will let it grow and flouriſh ſtill, and neuer puniſh the offenders thereof. The grieuouſneſſe of which ſinne you may ſee notably in the examples of <hi>Ely</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Saul</hi> the King.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:173667:74"/>For the Lord had brought moſt terrible iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, and vpon their poſterity after them for the ſaine ſinne and offence of theirs: Vpon the one of them, becauſe he ſpared his ſonnes, and did not puniſh them according to their deſerts, as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the firſt booke of <hi>Samuel</hi> doth ſhew: And vpon the other, of them, becauſe he ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> the Amalekite, and did not kill him, according to Gods commandement, as it is in the 15. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame booke. Here, here, beloued, it may go neare vnto our hearts, and cauſe vs to ſigh and ſob within our ſelues, when we conſider, how blaſphemy, the contempt of the Word, the breach of the Sabboth, diſobedience to gouernors, adulterie, drunkenneſſe, and other grieuous offences (which make the Sun as it were bluſh againe to behold them) do go vncontrolled and vncorrected in our times, and haue no ſeuere puniſhments infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon them for the reſtraint thereof, as they do deſerue. We haue as good lawes, as any nation in the world, but they want ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, which is the life of them: and thoſe that ſhould looke moſt vnto them, do neglect them commonly moſt, and not onely breake them themſelues, but countenance others alſo that do it. But let ſuperiors remember what the Lord doth ſay by <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet in chapter 48.10. <hi>Curſed be he that doth the worke of the Lordnegligently, and curſed be he, that keepeth backe his ſword from bloud.</hi> So that there muſt be no ſparing of men, vnder a curſe and damnation, when God will haue them killed. And let them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beare in their minds what God did ſay to <hi>Ahab</hi> the king, in 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 20.42. ſaying, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt let go out of thy hands a man whom I appointed to die, thy life ſhall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</hi> So that to ſpare a malefactor from death, is to bring death vnto themſelues, and to ſuch as do belong vnto them.</p>

And albeit <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> were very milde men, and mercifull, yet <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Shemei</hi> muſt be ſlaine &amp; put to death by them, as may be ſeene in the ſecond chapter of the firſt booke of the <hi>Kings.</hi> And as one doth well obſerue of them, either of them did ſanctifie their hands by this ſeuerity, in executing iuſtice belonging to them; which otherwiſe they ſhould haue defiled by vnlawfull lenity and ſparing. You know it is no fault in a Chirurgion to cut off a corrupt member for the ſauing of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. So in a Magiſtrate it is no cruelty but vertue, to preferre the ſafety of many before a few. Let not then a ſuperſtitious affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of clemency or pitty make a more cruell gentleneſſe, with the perill and hurt of many. For vnder the gouerment of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Nerua</hi> it was rightly ſaid: <hi>It is ill dwelling vnder a king or Magistrate where nothing is lawfull, but it is far worſe dwelling vnder one where all things are lawfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, here we may be put in mind, what we our ſelues ought to do, and that is this: we muſt neither ſpare ſinnes in our ſelues, nor in others, but we muſt labour to bring all to repentance and amendment of life, by inflicting deſerued puniſhments vpon both. Firſt we muſt deale with our ſelues, and after we haue ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to repentance, wee muſt take an holy reuenge vpon our ſelues (as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2.) in pinching our owne ſoules and bodies, in thoſe things wherein we paſſed our bounds before, and in reſtraining our ſelues from ſome things, which are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:173667:75"/>moſt lawfull in themſelues. Then for others, as we muſt not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance any in their euil waies, nor become aduocates vnto others for them: ſo, if power and authority do reſt in our owne hands, we muſt ſtrike them, and ſee them iuſtly puniſhed for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Herein let gouernours of families looke to themſelues, as well as Conſtables &amp; other officers. Beloued, you muſt know that, when enormities &amp; grieuous ſins are committed in your Pariſhes, or in your houſes, you are not to winke at the ſame, but according to your places you are to ſee the ſame iuſtly puniſhed. O reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the reaſons that were alleadged before, to awaken you vp to this duty, and let them ſinke deepely into your hearts, to bring forth a notable effect with them within you. Haue a care (I beſeech you) of the offenders, that they may be reclaimed: haue a care of others, that they may not be corrupted: haue a care of the whole land, that that may not be plagued: and haue a care, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of your owne perſons, that they may not be deſtroyed. Let none of theſe euils fall out through your defaults, for want of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſuch as doe offend. And herein you muſt ſpare none. <hi>Thine eye</hi> (ſaith the Lord, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.21) <hi>ſhall haue no compaſſion, but life for life, &amp;c.</hi> And in the 13. chapter of the ſame booke, the ſixth verſe and ſo forward, he doth declare, that though they be moſt deare and neare vnto vs, as our owne children, brothers, wiues, and friends, that are to vs as our owne ſoules, that do offend, and go about to draw our heartes away from the true God; yet they muſt not be ſpared, but be ſtoned to death, and that our owne hands muſt be firſt vnto it: and therefore deale vnpartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all; fauour none before others (as the world doth) but deale with all according to their waies.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto from the beginning of the Pſalme to this place, all things haue paſſed along by way of doctrine, in a certaine continued narration of ſpeech, after the manner of a ſtory; but now commeth an exhortation to hand, wherein all the former rebels (ſtanding in moſt woefull caſe, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perill of their liues) are graciouſly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon, to returne and to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the Lord and his Annoynted, againſt whom they made their former rebellion and inſurrection. Great was the ſin, which they had committed; yet the Lord (whoſe mercy hath neither bottome nor meaſure) not willing the death of any ſinner, much leſſe of ſo many thouſands together, but rather that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance pardon may be procured; in this place fauourably vſeth the meanes, that their hearts may ſmite them with true feeling of their faults, and ſo they turne &amp; be ſpared. He cals vpon them all for true repentance and amendment of life, ſhewing vnto them, both wherein it doth ſtand, and alſo when it muſt be yeelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. It ſtandeth in two things, the one is an heauenly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and an holy knowledge of the Lords waies. The other is a loyall ſubiection, and a faithfull obedience vnto his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Both theſe he doth require of them. Firſt, that they be wiſe and learned, in his word or ſtatutes; then ſecondly, that they be ſubiect and obedient vnto him and his Sonne, in performing ſuch duties as do belong vnto them. And as for the time, when theſe things are to be done, it is ſtraight, and out of hand; they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:173667:76"/>muſt not deferre them, no not ſo much as one day, but preſently they muſt goe about them whithout any delay, or procraſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoeuer. This is the ſumme of this verſe with the two next following. But to leaue them at this time, and to ſtand one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon this, marke the paraphraſe thereof, it runneth after this manner. <hi>Now</hi> therefore (ſaith the Prophet) while there is time, before the iudgement before ſpoken of do ouertake you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you to nothing, labour you to get true wiſdome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; plant you the word of the Lord in your ſoules, and be well ſeene and learned in his ſtatutes, that you may know your ſelues, and vnderſtand aright, what the Lord your God doth require at your hands, for all matters, which do reſpect his worſhip, and your owne peace. And here I ſpeake not alone to the ſmall ones, and the baſer ſort of the people, but I ſpeake to you all, and chiefly to you, that are the great ones, and the ſtates of the land, euen to you that are Princes, and haue the chiefe ſtroke in matters of gouernment, and to you that are Iudges and haue authority to ſit vpon life and death, and to cenſure all matters and perſons, that are brought before you: to you, I ſay, do I chiefly ſpeake, and therefore looke to your ſelues, deferre not your repentance any longer, but preſently while you haue time, be wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>So that the ſumme of this verſe is nothing elſe,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Summe. </seg>
               </label> but an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vnto the firſt part of repentance, which ſtandeth in the true knowledge of the Lord and his wayes, wherein remember two points.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>
               </label> Firſt the perſons to whom the exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is directed; then ſecondly the matter, to the which they are exhorted, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt the time, when the duty is to be done, which he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them; then the thing it ſelfe wherein it doth ſtand, or conſiſt.</p>
            <p>The perſons to whom the exhortation is directed, are the kings, and iudges of the land. The Spirit of the Lord doth ſingle them out by name from all the reſt: not meaning thereby, that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone were to do the things, that here and after he doth require of them; but his meaning is, by them to vnderſtand all of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſoeuer they were, by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> when ſome are put for all. For he would haue all to repent, and to ſubmit themſelues
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:173667:76"/>vnto the Lord, who before did rebell againſt him. But yet he nameth them onely, who were thus the Kings and Iudges of the land, for ſundry cauſes. As firſt, becauſe they were deepeſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and had treſpaſſed moſt therein, as being the ringleaders of all the reſt. Secondly, becauſe they bad more things to ſtay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backe then others had, and a greater meanes to pull them from the performance of the exacted duties. And laſtly, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuerted would eaſily draw all others after them, and cauſe them to do as they had done. For the multitude commonly doth depend vpon the higher powers, and looke what they do, the ſame doth content them well, according to that in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.36. <hi>And all the people knew it</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Dauids</hi> mourning and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting for <hi>Abner</hi>) <hi>and it pleaſed them, as whatſoeuer the king did, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all the people.</hi> For theſe cauſes and the like, the holy Ghoſt might well direct his ſpeech by name vnto the Kings and Iudges, and not ſpeake in generall vnto all, though he did meane all, and his purpoſe were to haue euery one to do the things here exacted of them, and not that the Kings and Iudges ſhould doe them alone.</p>
            <p>Here by the way, we may obſerue a notable good inſtruction, which is this; namely, that Magiſtrates, and men in chiefe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould firſt of all turne vnto the Lord, and be as the captaines of all the reſt in performing loyall and faithfull obedience vnto him, in all dutifull manner, as it doth become them. For firſt and foremoſt they are more bound (as we ſay) vnto God, then others are, as hauing larger benefites, and greater giftes beſtowed vpon them then any beſides them haue; for the more bountifull that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is to vs, the more dutifull ſhould we be to him a gaine. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they (for the moſt part) go beyond all others in ſins and treſpaſſes for number and greatneſſe; for the more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſinnes and treſpaſſes be, the more ſpeed and haſt ſhould we make to leaue them, and to turne vnto the Lord from them, leſt they bring deſtruction vpon vs before we are aware. Finally, becauſe all others do hang vpon them, as the dore doth on the hinges, and turne as they doe turne; for whom alſo they muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere at the dreadfull day of iudgement, when all ſecrets of mens hearts ſhall be diſcloſed, and euery one ſhall receiue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:173667:77"/>to his waies. For the more that we may bring to God, and the heauier charge we haue to anſwere, the more forward ſhould we be to do thoſe holy duties which do belong to vs, that we might ſaue many, and not be damned our ſelues. Oh that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours would lay this neare vnto their hearts, and make a good vſe thereof vnto themſelues. Bleſſed, yea twiſe bleſſed then ſhould both they and we be. <hi>Abraham, Ioſuah, Samuel, Dauid, Aſa, Iehoſaphat, Hezechia, Ioſiah,</hi> and others, that were men of great place and authority, haue done this long before our daies. The Lord grant for his mercies ſake, that our rulers and chiefe men for gouernment may do it, &amp; alwaies do it in our daies, &amp; in the daies of our poſterity after vs. But if they ſhould faile herein (which God forbid) yet let vs who haue ſome authority ouer others, looke to our ſelues in this caſe, and performe that duty, which the Lord doth require of vs. We muſt not alone bring our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeruants to the knowledge of their ſins, and cauſe them to walke in the waies of the Lord: but we our ſelues muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in theſe duties, and by our examples leade them on to a carefull performance thereof. Firſt we our ſelues muſt turne to the Lord, and become moſt dutifull and loyall vnto him, and walke continually in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. Then when this is done, we muſt be moſt earneſt with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſee that they do the like: that ſo all of vs may ioyne together in turning vnto him, from whom we went aſtray, and redeeme (as it were) the time that is paſt, by an eager perſuing after all thoſe things, as do belong to vs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our roomes &amp; callings. I pray thinke on theſe matters, and I beſeech God, to giue a bleſſing vnto them, that they may do you good.</p>
            <p>But to to come to the chiefe point, which is here to be ſtood vpon, marke diligently, vpon what conſideration the Kings, and Iudges (and ſo all others in them) are called vpon to repentance and amendment of life. It is vpon the conſideration of the great perill and danger, wherein they ſtood. For the exhortation which is here made, is deduced out of the former words, and the manner how it is drawne ſtandeth thus. All thoſe that are in a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate, and are likely to be ouerthrowne with a ſhameful and perpetuall deſtruction, they had neede to be wiſe and learned,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:173667:77"/>and turne to the Lord, as it doth become them. But ſuch is your caſe, o Kings and Iudges, your are in a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate, and you are likely euery one of you to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne with a ſhamefull and perpetuall deſtruction. Therefore it ſtands you vpon to be wiſe and learned, and to turne to the Lord as it doth become you. From hence we gather this doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that where there is any perill or danger hanging ouer mens heads for their ſinnes and treſpaſſes, there they muſt repent and amend their liues, and turne to the Lord whom they haue offended. So did vncircumciſed <hi>Nineueh,</hi> For when the Prophet <hi>Ionah</hi> had cryed in their citty: and ſaid, <hi>Yet fourty daies, and</hi> Nineueh <hi>ſhall be ouerthrowne,</hi> they faſted and prayed, and did put on ſacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth from the greateſt of them euen to the leaſt of them, and did turne from their euill waies, and from the wickedneſſe that was in their hands, as we may ſee at large in the third chapter of the Prophecy of <hi>Ionah.</hi> So did wicked <hi>Ahab;</hi> for when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah</hi> had told him of his ſinne, and of Gods iudgements that did belong vnto him for the ſame, and had ſhewed him, how the Lord would bring euill vpon him, and his poſterity, <hi>and make his houſe like the houſe of</hi> Iereboam <hi>the ſon of</hi> Nebat, <hi>and like the houſe of</hi> Baaſha <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Ahijah <hi>for the prouocation wherewith he had prouoked and made Iſrael to ſinne;</hi> euen then, when he heard thoſe words: <hi>He rent his cloathes, and put ſackecloth vpon him and faſted, and lay in ſackecloth, and went ſoftly,</hi> as it is in 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27. So did ſtifnecked Iſrael. For when troubles did come vpon them, and miſeries were likely to weare them out, and to conſume them to nothing, they cryed from time to time vnto the Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed their ſinnes and tranſgreſſions before him, as may be ſeene at large in the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Iudges,</hi> the <hi>Kings,</hi> and the hundreth and ſeuen <hi>Pſalme.</hi> So, laſtly, did the prodigall ſonne; for when he ſaw all was ſpent, and he was like to die for hunger, as hauing nothing to eate, no not ſo much as the huskes, which the ſwinne did feed vpon, he came to himſelfe, and reſolued to returne home vnto his father, and to confeſſe his fault vnto him, and to craue fauour at his hands, as it is in <hi>Luke</hi> 15.16 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo he might be made as one of his hired ſeruants, if not to be accepted of him, as a deare ſonne and child againe. Thus you ſee, how
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:173667:78"/>perils and dangers ſhould moue vs to repentance and amendment of life.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is this,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
               </label> becauſe by repentance and amendment of life, all perils and dangers are preuented, and wholly remoued away from vs; as all the former recited examples do notably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs. But to adde a teſtimony or two thereunto, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the Lord himſelfe doth ſay, in <hi>Ieremy</hi> chapter 18. verſe 8. touching this matter in theſe word. <hi>But if this nation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>against whom I haue pronounced, turne from their wickedneſſe, I will repent of the plague that I thought to bring vpon them.</hi> And do you neuer forget what he alſo ſaid to <hi>Ioſiah</hi> the king in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.27.28. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thine heart did melt, and thou didst humble thy ſelfe before God, when thou heardeſt his word against this place, and againſt the inhabitants thereof, and humbledſt thy ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and tareſt thy clothes, and wepteſt before me; I haue alſo heard it, ſaith the Lord. Behold I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou ſhalt be put in thy graue in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſe all the euill which I will bring vpon this place, and vpon the inhabitants of the ſame.</hi> Moſt acceptable therfore (you ſee) vnto the Lord is an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſting downe of our ſelues before him, and ſhall bring vnto our ſoules mercy and comfort, when proud rebellion and ſtiffe ſtanding out with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and others, ſhall procure plague vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plague, till we be deſtroyed out of the world. Seeing then, that repentance doth ſtay the iudgements of God from falling downe vpon vs, and remoue them cleane away from vs, that they may do vs no hurt, there is cauſe ſufficient, why we ſhould repent and amend, when his iudgements do hang ouer our heads, and are likely euery houre to fall downe vpon vs to our deſtruction, and vtter vndoing.</p>
            <p>By this then we are taught firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> that they deale very fooliſhly and fondly, who being in perill and danger, do yet ſtill perſeuere on in their ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. Alas, it is like, as if a man ſhould remaine in an houſe, when the houſe is all one a fire ouer his head, and likely euery minute of an houre to conſume him, either by burning, or falling. Or elſe it is like, as if a man ſhould be in the midſt of a riuer, where he is ready continually to be drowned, and doth ſee no way to eſcape; yet will not ſtretch
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:173667:78"/>out his hand to lay hold of that which may ſaue his life, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto him a preſent ſuccour and aide.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hereby we may learne, what we our ſelues ought to do in all manner of diſtreſſes and calamities whatſoeuer. Is the hand of the Lord already vpon vs? or do we feare ſome iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come? Humble we our ſelues then before the Lord, be we ſory for our ſinnes, leaue we all our wicked wayes, and turne we ſoundly vnto the Almightie, and all ſhall be well with vs; both his hand that is vpon vs ſhall be remoued away, and thoſe iudgements that do hang ouer vs, ſhall be ſtaied, and neuer fall downe vpon vs. Neuer forget we that comfortable ſaying, which is in 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 7.14 and is vttered by God himſelfe in theſe words: <hi>If my people</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>among whom my name is called vpon, do humble themſelues, and pray, and ſeeke my preſence, and turne from their wicked wayes, then will I heare in heauen, and be mercifull to their ſinne, and will heale their land.</hi> Downe then at night, and downe in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before your God, ſend vp vnto him the true ſighes of an humble heart, and of a broken ſoule for all your tranſgreſſions; and aſſure your ſelues (as you liue and breathe) he will reſpect them with a ſauing grace. For he hath a moſt melting heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his poore people, that when the rod is euen vp, and he ready to ſmite, then, euen then, he ſtayeth his hand oftentimes of himſelfe, and is loath to ſtrike: yea he breaketh out into compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate words, ſuch as are in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.8. when he ſaith, <hi>How ſhall I giue thee vp, O</hi> Ephraim? <hi>how ſhall I deliuer thee, O Iſrael? How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>how ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>My hart is turned within me: my repentings are rolled together, I will not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the fierceneſſe of my wrath, &amp;c.</hi> as it is there in that place. Could euer any father ſpeake more compaſſionately ouer his child, when he were about to beate him? Surely no tongue can expreſſe the Lords goodneſſe and pitty towards vs. And therefore ſettle with your ſelues this comfort, that if you returne from your ſinnes, and once leaue your tranſgreſſions, he will not puniſh you, nor exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe iudgements vpon you, which you haue deſerued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But we are in no danger, may you ſay,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
               </label> and ſo need not to repent for that cauſe. For we liue in the dayes of peace, and no peril doth hang ouer our heads. <hi>Anſ.</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> Let no man deceiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:173667:79"/>For we all haue ſinned and treſpaſſed againſt the Lord, and his Annointed, as well as theſe Kings and Iudges had done, who are here called vpon to repentance and amendment of life; and looke what danger they ſtood in through their ſinnes and treſpaſſes; the ſame do we now ſtand in through our ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and therefore we haue as great need to repent, as they had. Will you, that I ſpeake all in one word? Then thus it is. Euery perſon of vs haue deſerued to be caſt into hell, forasmuch as we do daily breake the commandements of God, and all the iudgements that are there do of right belong vnto vs, and we are liable vnto them euery houre, yea euery minute of an houre; and therefore, I ſay, we haue great need to repent, to auoide them. Queſtionleſſe, the more we ſtand out, the worſe it will be for vs. We our ſelues diſlike haughtie pride in others towards vs, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in ſuch as owe vs duty and obedience; and humble and meeke ſpirits we take pleaſure in. He that yeeldeth when we chide, and ſtoopeth to vs when we are angry, we quickly obſerue, and readily receiue to fauour againe. How much more, thinke you, are theſe things due to God from duſt and aſhes? Follow then what to him, you know, is pleaſing, and to your ſelues euer profitable. An army of ſouldiers ſhall not ſooner repell our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from vs, then true repentance ſhall the Lords wrath, that hangeth ouer vs. That is the onely thing that can make vp the hedge, and ſtand in the gap before the Lord for vs, that he ſhould not deſtroy vs. For the Lord cannot ſtrike vs, when we hold vp our hands for mercy, and looke vpon him with watery eyes, humbled in the duſt before him, and for Chriſt begging pardon at his hands. And therefore euer make vp this wall of defence by true prayer, and hearty repentance againſt him, and ſtand your ſelues in the gap, thus crying vnto him in his Sonne againſt your ſinnes, and be aſſured you ſhall preuaile.</p>
            <p>But alas, men do faile much in the performance of this dutie. It may grieue a good heart and ſoule to thinke, how wretchleſſe and careleſſe they are therein. Though iudgements lie heauy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of them already, yet they repent not, nor returne to the Lord. The ſickneſſe that is vpon them, the vexation of ſpirit that is within them, the vntowardneſſe of their children and ſeruants
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:173667:79"/>that are neare vnto them, and the loſſe of their goods, which do decay each day more and more round about them, cannot rouze them vp from their ſinnes, nor conuert them ſoundly vnto the Lood, but they continue ſtill in their tranſgreſſions, and grow rather worſe, then better therein, adding drunkenneſſe vnto thirſt, and one ſinne vnto another. God amend them, if it be his pleaſure, and giue vnto them better hearts. Others there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, who yet are ſpared, ouer whom notwithſtanding the iudgements of the Lord do hang in a moſt fearefull and cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent manner. For they are likely euery houre to haue ſome plague fall vpon them, and to be carried away body and ſoule to hell, their ſinnes and abhominations are ſo vile and filthy before the Lord. But yet alas, they perſeuere on ſtill in their euill wayes, and take not this holy courſe of repentance, to ſtop the Lords iudgements from falling downe vpon them, and to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from that ſulphurian and euer-tormenting place.</p>
            <p>It is noted of the wiſe man in the Prouerbes, chapter 23.3. that he <hi>ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe; but the fooliſh</hi> (on the the contrary ſide) <hi>goe on ſtill, and are puniſhed,</hi> Deale we, as this wiſe man, and not as the foole. Looke we vpon our dangers, and labour we by a ſound conuerſion vnto the Lord to preuent them: otherwiſe the Lord himſelfe will ſay of vs, as he did of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when he ſayd, <hi>The ſorrowes of a trauelling woman ſhall come vpon him, he is an vnwiſe ſonne, elſe would he not ſtand ſtill at the time, euen at the breaking forth of the children,</hi> Hoſea 12.13. Great ſtirre doth euery man almoſt make, when his aduerſarie commeth to take the poſſeſſion of his houſe and liuing ouer his head, and that by force and violence: or when the Shrieffes men do approach neare to take him, and to carry him to the gaole, where he knowes he ſhall lie in wofull miſerie ſome time, and in the end leeſe his life by a ſhamefull death. Oh what ado then is there? what ſhiftings then do enter into mans heart? No ſtone then (as we ſay) is left vnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but euery courſe that may be thought vpon is taken, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent that perill and danger. And yet ſhall men lie ſtill, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the danger of hel, which is 10000. times worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any priſon or death in this world, &amp; brings with it more troubles by millions, then euer the loſſe of any houſe or liuing can do
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:173667:80"/>here? Awake we, awake we; and if euer men will beſtirre their ſtumpes, (as it is in our prouerbe) now let them beſtirre them, and with all haſt let them runne vnto the Lord for mercie and grace, before his wrath breake out and conſume them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, by this we may learne, what counſell and aduice to giue to others, when they are in ſome danger, and know not well what courſe to take to rid themſelues there-from. If any of them ſhall come vnto vs, as the Iewes did to the Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Acts 2.37. we may eaſily anſwer them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as it is here, <hi>Be wiſe and learned, &amp;c.</hi> that is, repent you of your ſinnes, and ſubmit your ſelues vnto the Lord your God in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull obedience, as it doth become you. This, this is the onely courſe that you muſt take. Doubtleſſe no other courſe in the world can do you any ſound and perfect good; but if you ſhall once performe this, all ſhall be well with you quickly; as it was with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who vpon his ſubmiſſion vnto the Lord, was reſtored againe to his kingdome; or as it was with <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> who vpon his prayer vnto the Lord, and hearty ſorrow for his ſinne was deliuered out of his priſon at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and reëſtabliſhed againe in the throne of his kingdome at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> or laſtly as it was with the Iſraelites, who vpon their crie vnto the Lord, and the confeſſion of their ſinne, were from time to time deliuered from their enimies, and bleſſed with peace, and abundance of good things.</p>
            <p>Hitherto for the perſons, to whom the exhortation is directed: now let vs come to the matter, whereof it doth conſiſt. And that in a word is repentance and amendment of life, as I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Wherein is conteined firſt the time, when it muſt be had, then ſecondly the points, wherein it doth ſtand. The time is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſet downe in this word, <hi>Now.</hi> Becauſe they were in a preſent danger, and were likely euery houre to be deſtroyed; therefore the Prophet would haue them to repent preſently, and out of hand, euen before thoſe iudgements of the Lord did fall vpon them, which were mentioned before in the 5. and 9. verſes of this Pſalme. Wherehence we are taught this doctrine, that men muſt out of hand repent and turne to the Lord, and not deferre their conuerſion from time to time, but preſently goe about the ſame.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:173667:80"/>
               <hi>Seeke the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 55.6.7.) <hi>while he may be found, call ye vpon him, while he is neare. Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his wayes, and the vurighteous his owne imaginations, and returne vnto the Lord, and he will haue mercy vpon him, and to our God, for he is very ready to forgiue. While we haue time</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paule</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>let vs do good vnto all men, but ſpecially vnto them that are of the houſhold of faith.</hi> And <hi>to day</hi> (ſaith the holy Ghoſt in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>if ye ſhall heare his voyce, harden not your hearts, as in the prouocation, according to the day of the temptation in the wilderneſſe; but exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne.</hi> Thus you ſee ſhortly the verity of the doctrine, and the confirmation thereof.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons of it are many, but chiefly theſe foure. Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> becauſe it is vncertaine, whether we ſhall liue any longer, or no. For the yong do die, as well as the aged, and men are oftentimes taken away on the ſudden. <hi>Thou foole</hi> (ſaith God to the rich man in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20.) <hi>this night will they fetch away thy ſoule from thee, then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be, which thou haſt prouided?</hi> And <hi>when men ſhall ſay</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3.) <hi>peace and ſafety, then ſhall come vpon them ſudden destruction, as the trauaile of a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi> Many examples we haue hereof in the Scriptures. The world thought themſelues ſure, when they were eating and drinking, but then came the floud, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.27. The morning was faire, when <hi>Lot</hi> went out of Sodom, and yet before night, were the Sodomites deſtroyed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.23. <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> thought himſelfe neuer more ſure, then when he had builded great Babell, but yet while the word was in his mouth, God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him downe vpon his knees. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.12. And well was <hi>Herod</hi> when he began his Oration to the people, but before the end thereof, &amp; his departure from them, the Angell of the Lord ſmote him, ſo that he was eaten of wormes, and gaue vp the ghoſt. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. So that if we do deferre our repentance but one day, yea but one houre, death may preuent vs, before that we can repent, and ſo we ſhall be damned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the longer that a man doth poſt off his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and amendment of life, the harder it will be for him to repent and amend at the laſt. <hi>Can the blacke Moore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ieremy</hi> in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:173667:81"/>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.23.) <hi>change his skinne, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do euill.</hi> As though it were a thing vnpoſſible for a ſinner, who hath continued long in his ſinne, to leaue his ſinne, and to forſake it, and ſo to become a good man at the laſt. And ſurely with man it is vnpoſſible, though it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with God, vnto whom all things are poſſible. For if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ouercome a Lyon, when it is yong, and but a whelpe; how ſhall we be able to ouercome him, when he is old, and growne to his full power and ſtrength? And if we be not able to bow a tree of ſixe yeares growth, it is in vaine for vs to go about to bow it, when it is twentie yeares old or more. So, euen ſo, it is alſo with ſinne; the longer that we ſhall nouriſh it in our boſomes, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it will be for vs to ouer-maiſter it in the end, yea it will be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for vs to do it. For that will grow ſtill ſtronger and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and we our ſelues ſhall be weaker and weaker. And therefore it is good to go about the cure of it betimes, as we do about the cure of ſuch wounds as are made in our bodies, knowing that the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger that they be deferred, the harder is their recouery at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe God is to be ſerued before all things (whether the world, the fleſh, or the diuell) as <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet would be ſerued before the widow that fed him. 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 17.13. <hi>Seeke firſt the kingdome of God</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour in <hi>Math.</hi> 6.33.) <hi>and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhall be miniſtred vnto you.</hi> So ſoone as man was created, a law was giuen him; to ſhew, that he ſhould liue vnder obedience from the day that he was borne in. So ſoone as he is borne, he is baptized in the name of God; to ſhew, that when we cannot runne to God, we ſhould creepe as it were to him. So ſoone as he beginneth to pray, he ſaith, <hi>Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdome come, &amp;c.</hi> before he aske his daily bread; to ſhew, that we ſhould ſeeke the ſanctification of Gods name, and the doing of his will before the food that we liue by, much more before the ſins and pleaſures which we periſh by. And ſo ſoone, laſtly, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth any talent or gift from aboue, he is commanded to vſe them; to ſhew, that we muſt go about the Lords buſineſſe, and not our owne, &amp; be occupied alone in ſuch matters, as may bring glory and honour vnto his name. So that nothing is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the Lord, but the Lord before all things: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:173667:81"/>repentance not to be deferred any time, but the workes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be done out of hand, that ſo God may haue his due and right, in being ſerued and honored before all things, as he ought to be.</p>
            <p>Finally, becauſe all ſeruice whatſoeuer is onely due vnto the Lord, who may iuſtly challenge vnto himſelfe (as his owne due and right) our ſelues, and all that we haue. <hi>Ye are bought for a price</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.) <hi>therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit; for they are Gods.</hi> We muſt loue the Lord our God (you know) with all our hearts, with all our ſoules, and with all our ſtrength. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. And we are deliuered from our enimies (you know alſo) to this end, that we ſhould ſerue the Lord in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.75. So that God muſt haue all, we may not take ſo much as an houre, no not ſo much as a minute of an houre, and beſtow the ſame vpon the ſeruice of the world, the fleſh, or the diuell, but he that hath made vs, muſt haue euery part and portion thereof. And therfore in all theſe reſpects, you ſee, we muſt immediatly without any further delay apply our hearts to wiſedome, and ſeeke only thoſe things, which do concerne the Lord and his worſhip, and take no more care for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof.</p>
            <p>The vſe hereof ſtandeth chiefly in three things.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> The firſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great folly and wickedneſſe that is in the world, whoſe propertie is euermore, to deferre their repentance till the laſt. If we ſhould ſee a man wounded to death (as we ſpeake,) that is ſorely hurt, and mangled in his body, and yet would ſeeke for no remedy to cure himſelfe, which might be had preſently, but would poſt it off from day to day a long time together; we ſhould thinke that he were deſperate or fooliſh. Or if we ſhould heare of a man, that hauing offended the kings Maieſtie, and for the ſame were likely to be put to death, who yet would not ſeeke to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his wrath, and to ſtay the execution againſt himſelfe, though he did know how to do it, but would deferre it from time to time, and ſay, that he would conſult thereof hereafter; braine ſicke and mad would we take him to be. So, euen ſo, doth the world deale. For though they know how to aſſwage Gods anger, that is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt them for their ſinnes, yet they will not take that courſe in hand, but they will poſt it off till the laſt, and ſo hazard their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:173667:82"/>eternall ſaluation vpon an vncertaintie. Herein the diuell doth moſt bewitch them, and lull them faſt aſleepe in the bed of their ſecuritie. Looke how racking vſurers are wont to giue day to yong heires from time to time, vntill at laſt they winde their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance from them: So doth he deale with them; he doth harden them on ſtill from day to day in their ſinnes, vntill he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them for his owne inheritance, and firme poſſeſſion in hell for euer.</p>
            <p>But to leaue the world, let vs come to our ſelues: out of this in the ſecond place we may learne, that it is our part and dutie, not to runne on ſtill in our tranſgreſſions, as the moſt do, but preſently and out of hand to leaue them, and to turne vnto the Lord our God. As <hi>Abraham</hi> roſe vp betimes in the morning, and deferred no time, to go to ſacrifice his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> according to Gods commandement, as it is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.3: So we muſt make haſt, and poſt off no day, to go to ſacrifice our ſinnes and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, that do offend the Lord and diſpleaſe him. All of vs do confeſſe that our ſinnes muſt be left, and that God muſt be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but we cannot accord of the time, when to begin. One ſaith, he will begin, when he is rich; another ſaith, he will begin when he is free; an other ſaith, he will begin, when he is ſettled; an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, he will begin, when he is out of debt; an other ſaith, he will begin, when he is old, and ſo forward. We are like the Iewes in the firſt of <hi>Haggay,</hi> who ſaid: <hi>The time was not yet come when they ſhould build the Temple.</hi> But beloued the time is preſent, we muſt change our minds out of hand, and turne to the Lord. Did euer any whom we reade of in the Scriptures, feeling the piercing power of Gods Spirit, ſmitting vpon the rocks of their hidden hearts within, take time with the Lord and ſay. They would yeeld after two moneths, foure moneths, or the like? No, no, they did not couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the Lord for any time, but preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly they were conuerted: they ſtaied not an houre houering &amp; ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, looking backe to <hi>Sodom</hi> with <hi>Lots</hi> wife, or to <hi>Aegypt</hi> with the Iewes, but ioyfully embraced the truth without delay. To day, to day is the voice of God, as you haue heard, and to morrow, to morrow is the voyce of Satan Chriſt (you know) would not ſuffer one of his Diſciples to go home, as it were to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:173667:82"/>bury his father, but he muſt leaue that buſineſſe to others, and come and follow him, as it is in <hi>Math.</hi> 8.22. So that no delay in the world muſt be made, but immeadiatly we muſt leaue our ſinnes, and go about the Lords buſineſſe. Many reaſons there are (as you haue heard before) to moue vs vp thereunto: I pray, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them well, and let them ſtirre you vp to the diſcharge of your dutie, that this day wherein I do now ſpeake vnto you, may be the day of your ſound co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Lord, &amp; for the which hereafter you may reioyce for euermore. Say not with your ſelues, that you will repent hereafter. For firſt, you are not ſure that you ſhall liue till hereafter. As the Iſraelites died while the meate was in their mouthes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.33. And as <hi>Iobs</hi> children were killed as they were banquetting in their eldeſt brothers houſe. <hi>Iob</hi> 1.18. So may you die, or be killed on the ſuddaine before you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. <hi>Goe to now</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.13.14.) <hi>ye that ſay, To day or to morrow we will goe into ſuch a citty, and continue there a yeare, and buie and ſell, and get gaine: and yet yee cannot tell what ſhall be to morrow. For what is your life? It is euen a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and afterward vaniſheth away.</hi> Secondly, if you had a charter of your liues (as no man hath) and ſo were ſure to liue till hereafter, yet you are not certaine, that then you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. For repentance is not at your commandement, neither doth it lie in your power to take it, when you will: but it is the onely gift of God, and in his hands alone to beſtow it vpon whom he will, as you may ſee plainly by <hi>Pauls</hi> words in the latter end of the 2. chapter of his 2. Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> And the longer that you do continue in your ſinnes (as you haue heard already) the harder it will be for you to leaue them in the end. For cuſtome of ſinning taketh away the ſence of ſinning, and long abode in darkeneſſe maketh ſtarke blind. Laſtly, if repentance were in your power (as it is not in the power of any mortall man whatſoeuer) and ſo you were certaine to turne at the laſt, if you would; yet you ought to repent preſently, becauſe your ſelues and all that you haue or can do, do belong to the Lord your God, who muſt be preferred before all things, as was ſhewed before vnto you. For God muſt haue a morning ſacrifice, as well as an euening. And it is very abſurd and wicked, for a man to offer the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:173667:83"/>firſt of his vintage to the delights of ſinne, and to ſerue God with the lees and dregs of his age: or to yeeld the flower and ſtrength of his life vnto the foule affections of wretched nature, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue for God the very refuſe and weakneſſe of his time: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turne, turne I beſeech you, euen now preſently, and make no longer delay. I ſpeake to you young men and maides, becauſe you muſt remember your Creator in the daies of your youth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore old age doth come, as <hi>Salomon</hi> doth teach you in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1: and becauſe you are now apteſt and fitteſt to do ſeruice vnto the Almighty, as hauing all the powers of the body and ſoule in the chiefeſt vigor and ſtrength, for the exerciſes of pure and holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. You muſt not ſpend your time in vanity, or in the carnall pleaſures of your fleſh, after the manner of wicked yong men and maids; but in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, according to the vow and promiſe, which you haue made with your God in baptiſme; after the manner of godly yong men and maides, who are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and adopted to life eternall. And to reſtraine your ſelues the better in, you muſt alwaies remember with your ſelues, that you ſhall be brought at the day of indgement, to anſwere for euery thing, which you ſhall do amiſſe in this time of your youth, be it great or ſmal, whether words or deeds, as you may ſee in the end of the eleuenth chapter of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> I ſpeake to you old men and women, becauſe you haue lien too long in your ſinnes, and are ready to droppe into the graue. For it is too much already, that you haue ſpent your former time, after the luſts of men, and not after the will of God, in much wickedneſſe and abhominations. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand vp from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue thee light:</hi> ſo I ſay to you, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake all you that ſleepe in your ſinnes, and ſtand vp all you that are dead in your treſpaſſes, and ſo the Lord ſhall giue you life, and not death. It was too late (you know) for the fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to knocke, when the gate was ſhut againſt them; and for the rich glutton to howle and cry to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in hell. So before it be too late for you, remember your ſelues, and while you haue light walke in the light, and betake your ſelues ſoundly vnto the Lord, as it doth become you. In a word, I ſpeake to you all without exception, becauſe I loue you all, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:173667:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>would gladly haue you godly here, &amp; veſſels of glory hereafter; happy for this world, and happy for the world to come: make no couenant with your ſinnes, but renounce them all from this day forward for euermore. And albeit they ſhall as it were; cry out and ſay, <hi>Why do you come to diſmiſſe vs before the time?</hi> As the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels ſaid to Chriſt, when he did caſt them out, <hi>Why doſt thou tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vs before the time?</hi> yet hearken not vnto them, but giue them a deafe eare. For the time 1<hi rend="sup">e</hi> already come, if not paſt already. For we ſhould haue repented long ago in ſackecloth and aſhes, if we had done as we ought to haue done; but yet now, now let vs turne, and deferre no day or houre longer, but while the word is ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our eares, let vs be conuerted vnto the Lord. He is the fondeſt fellow that euer was heard of, who falling into a deepe riuer, and hauing preſent helpe offered him, whilſt he is yet ſwimming on the toppe of the water, maketh refuſall of it, and anſwereth, that he will not be helped till another time, or before the next day; when as he is in danger to ſinke preſently, and to be drowned euery minute of an houre. Beware we that we deale not after the ſame manner; for if we ſhall deferre our repentance and conuerſion to God, our caſe is no better then his. For euery minute of an houre we ſtand liable through our ſins to be throwne into hell. What? ſhall we then ſtay and not turne? As God ſaid to Iſrael, <hi>Turne you, turne you from your euill waies: for why will you die, ô houſe of Iſrael?</hi> ſo ſay I to you; Turne you, turne you from your cuill waies; for why will you die, ô people of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</p>
            <p>Some (I grant) will out of hand repent in words, but not in deeds: they haue <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſmooth voyce, but <hi>Eſaus</hi> rough hands. Their mouthes (as one ſaith) are greater then their hands, which is monſtrous in nature: for they word it much, but they worke it little. As the figge tree (ſpoken of in the Goſpell) had faire leaues, but no figges: ſo they haue goodly words, but no holy workes. They are deciptfull <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and painted tombes, like the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Scribes and Phariſies. But we muſt do otherwiſe, wee muſt be ſound in heart as <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was, who was a true Iſraelite; and be plentifull in good deeds, as <hi>Iob</hi> was, who was a true child of God: we muſt repent both inwardly and outwardly, in word
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:173667:84"/>and in worke: and ſo I hope you will doe, as alſo make haſt for to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But here ſome man may ſay, what a ſtirre is here about repentance? here is more haſt required, then needs for: a ſoft fire makes ſweet malt: we may repent at our ley ſure. For firſt, <hi>nullum tempus eſt poenitentiae inidoneum,</hi> there is no time vnfit for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Secondly, <hi>Deus eſt Deus miſericordiae,</hi> God is a God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he will forgiue vs, whenſoeuer we ſhall repent and turne to him. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This, this hath alwayes bene the faſhion of the world. Looke how indulgent mothers are wont to deale with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren going to ſchoole, that haue ouer-ſlept themſelues, and do feare the correction of their maiſters: euen ſo do carnall men and women deale with themſelues, when they haue continued too long in their ſinnes, and do heare the iudgements of the Lord ſounded out of his word againſt them for the ſame. For as theſe mothers are wont commonly to comfort their children (thus fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) with one of theſe two things, either that there is no time yet paſt, or elſe if the time be paſt, that their maiſter is a gentle man, and will forgiue them: So they do vſually heart on themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all feare &amp; dread whatſoeuer, by the conſideration of theſe two things; firſt, that there is no time vnfit or too late for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: ſecondly, that God is a mercifull God, and one moſt ready to forgiue them, though they haue poſted off their repentance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-long, and haue not turned vnto him in time, as they ought to hane done.</p>
            <p>In this ſnare and cord of the diuell, leſt you alſo ſhould be led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to your deſtruction at the laſt, marke what anſwer may be giuen to theſe things. To the firſt it may be ſayd, that though no time be vnfit or too late for repentance, while we are here in this world; yet oftentimes we are taken out of this world, before that we can thinke of repentance, and ſoundly turne vnto the Lord. For as many are taken away on the ſudden, ſo it fals out by the iuſt iudgment of God moſt vſually (as an ancient Father doth wel ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue) <hi>vt moriens obliuiſcatur ſui, qui cum viueret oblitus est Dei,</hi> That he ſhould forget himſelfe in the time of his death, who did forget God in the time of his life. Againe you muſt know, that late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is ſeldome or neuer good and true, but alwaies for the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:173667:84"/>moſt part feigned and diſſembled, like to that which was in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Ahab, Saul,</hi> and others, who ſeemed to be ſorry for their ſinnes, and deſirous to haue the hand of the Lord remoued from them. For <hi>qualis vita, finis ita,</hi> ſuch as the life is, ſuch common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the death. A good man hath a good end, and a bad man hath a bad end. Laſtly, you muſt alwaies remember what was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; namely, that repentance is not in our power, and that we cannot turne to God, when we will. And therefore as a begger muſt take his almes, when it is offered vnto him, and not refuſe it, becauſe there is no time amiſſe to take an almes: ſo we muſt take repentance when the Lord doth offer it vnto vs, and not vpon ſuch a fooliſh conſideration caſt it off, as now was touched. Now to the ſecond it may be anſwered, that though God be a God of mercy, receiuing all ſinners vnto himſelfe vpon their repentance and amendment of life: yet he is withall a God of iuſtice, <hi>viſiting the iniquities of the fathers vpon the children vnto the third and fourth generation of all ſuch as do hate him,</hi> as you are taught in the end of the ſecond commandement. <hi>Dauid</hi> tels vs in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.26. that he <hi>will ſhew himſelfe froward with the froward. Salomon</hi> ſheweth in <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.34. that <hi>with the ſcornefull he ſcorneth.</hi> And in the firſt chapter of the ſame booke, Wiſedome her ſelfe informeth vs, that ſhe will not regard wilfull and obſtinate ſinners, turning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her; in verſe 28. ſaying: <hi>Then ſhall they call vpon me, but I will not anſwere, they ſhall ſeeke me early, but they ſhall not finde me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lord.</hi> You know, how the Lord did ſware in his wrath, that the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites that did prouoke him in the wildernes, ſhould not enter into his reſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.8. So that God will be farre off at ſuch a time to giue repentance, and vpon repentance to receiue to mercy. And therefore as the women ſung concerning <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſaying: Saul <hi>hath ſlaine his thouſand, and</hi> Dauid <hi>his ten thouſand.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.7. ſo we may mournefully ſing, that the deſpaire of Gods mercy hath ſlaine thouſands, but the groſſe preſumption of his mercy, hath ſlaine ten thouſands. Wherefore to conclude this point, let neither of theſe impediments, nor any other whatſoeuer, hinder you from a preſent conuerſion vnto the Lord, but out of hand take him for your onely God, and ſerue him.</p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:173667:85"/>
            <p> Laſtly, here we may learne, what to do in regard of thoſe, who are vnder vs. We muſt not ſuffer them to go on ſtill in their ſins, but breake them quickely to the Lords yoake and bow. He is a fond fellow, that will not breake his horſe, while it is a colt, but let him runne on till he be old, and ſhall fling him into the ditch. And he deales very fooliſhly, that hauing a beautifull ſtanding cuppe, and very precious balme giuen vnto him to put into the cuppe, will not yet put it in, before the cup hath ſtood long full of ſtinking liquor: So we our ſelues ſhall be no better, if we ſhall ſuffer our children, and others vnder our tuition, to go on in their childhood and youth vnnurtured in the waies of the Lord, and ſuffer them to liue after their owne will, and to drink in the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyſon of the world, whereby they ſhall be made vnable to be reclaimed at the laſt. But teach we them betimes, and labour we to bring them to the knowledge of the Lord, and obedience vnto his will: ſo ſhall not ſinne be their deſtruction, nor rebellion be their ouerthrow. But more of this elſewhere.</p>
            <p>As thus we haue heard when we muſt repent, ſo now let vs heare, wherin repentance doth ſtand. And that is in two points, the one is knowledge or vnderſtanding; the other is obedience or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. Of the former of theſe mention is made in this verſe; of the latter in the following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bewiſe</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>ye Kings, be learned ye Iudges of the earth.</hi> Here is that knowledge &amp; vnderſtanding expreſſed, which is required of vs in euery true &amp; ſound repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but what means the Prophet hereby, may you ſay? were the Kings vnwiſe? and were the Iudges of the earth vnlearned? Yes ſurely, for otherwiſe they would neuer haue rebelled againſt the Lord and his annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they did. Yet his meaning is not, that they were altogether without wiſedome and learning: for they had wordly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning in great aboundance; but that they wanted the heauenly wiſedome and learning, &amp; therefore he doth exhort them to looke for that. Marke here, there is a two-fold wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning; one that is earthly and from man: an other that is heauenly, and from God. <hi>The children of this world</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.8.) <hi>are wiſer in their generation, then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light.</hi> In which words he doth intimate, that as there are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:173667:85"/>two ſorts of men; the one wicked, called the children of this world; the other godly, termed the children of light: ſo there are two ſorts of wiſedome, the one for the body and this life; the other for the ſoule and the life to come. This latter wiſedome the Kings and Iudges (here) wanted, but the former they had. For the body and this life they were wiſe and learned, they knew well enough how to rule and gouerne, and to turne all things to their greateſt honour and profit, that might be. But for the ſoule and life to come they were vnwiſe, and vnlearned: they had no good experience in the word of God, nor any ſound knowledge to do their ſoules good, but herein (I ſay) they were vnlearned, and no better then fooles before the Almighty. This the Apoſtle doth make moſt cleare and euident in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the ſecond chapter thereof, the ſixth verſe and ſo forward, when he ſaith: <hi>And we ſpeake wiſedome among them that are perfect, not the wiſedome of this world, neither of the Princes of this world, which come to nought: but we ſpeake the wiſedome of God in a mysterie, euen the hid wiſedome, which God had determined before the world vnto our glory, which none of the Princes of this world hath knowne. For had they knowne it, they would not haue crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> Loe, here you ſee, that the Apoſtle doth not onely ſay, that the Princes of this world (who are here in our text ſpoken vnto by the name of Kings and Iudges) are without the true and heauenly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, but alſo doth proue it to be ſo, euen becauſe that they did oppoſe themſelues againſt the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and did put him to death.</p>
            <p>Wherefore here by the way we may obſerue, that in truth, and before the Lord, all are fooles and vnlearned, who do withſtand Ieſus Chriſt, and his kingdome, and do liue wretchedly, and not according to the Lords commandements. Howſoeuer they be for this world, men of great reach and policie, and be well ſchooled in all kind of literature for the gouernment of humane life, and the procuring of much honour and wealth vnto themſelues: yet being ignorant in the word of God, and not ſeaſoned with an heauenly wiſdom, which may ſanctifie them in their waies, but do liue vngodly and vnholy liues: they, euen they, whatſoeuer they be, be vnwiſe and vnlearned, and no better then fooles &amp; idiots
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:173667:86"/>before the Almighty. For ſo alſo it doth pleaſe his Maieſty for to ſtyle them in his holy word, as you may ſee in many places of the <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> and namely in the firſt chapter thereof; as alſo in the fourteenth <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and ſundry other places beſides. Hereof is it, that that compariſon is made by our Sauiour himſelfe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 25. chapter of the Goſpell according to Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> wherein all wicked perſons are compared to fooliſh virgins, as the godly on the other ſide are compared vnto the wiſe virgins. And hereof alſo is that ſaying of <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>the wiſedome of this world is fooliſhneſſe with God;</hi> and that <hi>the Lord knoweth, that the thoughts of the wiſe are vanity.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Yea, but this ſhall neuer ſinke into mine head, may ſome man ſay, that thus the chiefe men of the country, &amp; thoſe that do beare the greateſt ſtroke and ſway amongſt men, and do know how to rule and gouerne themſelues and others well, ſhould after this ſort be reputed and taken for fooles, and vnlearned perſons, as you ſpeake; I thinke rather, that the godly, and thoſe that do reſort vnto Sermons are ſuch: for they are ſimple perſons in my iudgement, and very idiotes indeed. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be ſo indeed, for <hi>the naturall man perceiueth not the things of Gods Spirit:</hi> for they are fooliſhneſſe to him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, as it is in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. But conſider of things well, thou that art of that minde and opinion, tell me, what is the property of a wiſe man, and of one well learned? Is it not to walke circumſpectly, and to prouide beſt for himſelfe, as well for the time to come, as for the time that is preſent? Yes, for ſo we are taught in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. &amp; in <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, where the ſteward is commended for a wiſe man, for that he did prouide how to liue, when his maiſter ſhould take away from him his ſtewardſhip.</p>
            <p>Well then go on, tell me in the ſecond place, do thoſe walke cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly &amp; prouide beſt for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, who do war againſt the Lord &amp; his Annoynted, &amp; not fore caſt what ſhal become of them after this life, but do run on ſtill in their ſinnes, to be damned for euer? Anſwer me this point, if thou canſt. Suppoſe thou didſt ſee a man, who is but weake and feeble, taking vp weapons againſt his ſoueraigne Lord and King, who is moſt warlike and potent, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:173667:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>challenging him into the field; wouldſt not thou take him for a foole, and one deſtitute of good ſenſe and vnderſtanding? But ſo deale all wicked perſons (how politick or rich ſoeuer they be for this world.) For they are but weake and feeble perſons, yet they warre againſt their dread ſoueraigne the Lord and King, euen the mightie God of heauen, who is able in the twinckling of an eye to deſtroy them all. And yet ſhall they bee wiſe and prudent with thee? Suppoſe againe, that thou didſt behold one in a place, where is both gold and braſſe in great abundance, and goodly garments together with much baſe attire, ſo that it ſhould be lawfull for him to take of either of them moſt freely which he would himſelfe; yet he would not meddle of the gold, &amp; goodly garments, but would be exceeding buſie ſtill, in gathering vp the braſſe and baſe attire, reaching after one peece here, and another peece there; what wouldſt thou iudge of that partie? wouldſt not thou take him for a ſimple fellow, and a meere idiote? Yes, I muſt needs do that, thou wilt ſay. So, euen ſo, is the caſe here with men of this world. For whereas they might gather vp gold and goodly garments, that is, prouide for themſelues heauenly graces, and euerlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in new Ieruſalem aboue (where are more precious things, then euer the eye of man hath ſeene, or his eare hath heard of, or can enter into his heart) yet they leaue them, and occupy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wholely in gathering vp the braſſe and baſe attire; that is, they leaue the cate of heauen, and hunt after the world altogether, being very buſie about the pleaſures and commodities thereof, which are nothing in compariſon of heauen. And ſhall not they then bee vnwiſe and vnlearned with thee? But if thou wilt not count them ſo, yet the Lord doth, as thou haſt beard, and let this ſuffice vs. And by it let vs bee admoniſhed to take heed of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion &amp; wickedneſſe whatſoeuer, leſt we our ſelues be ſtyled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, and be regiſtred in the booke of God, for fooles &amp; vnlearned perſons. And ſo much ſhortly of this point bythe way.</p>
            <p>In that the Kings and Iudges are called vpon to be wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we obſerue this doctrine, that euery perſon muſt labour to get vnto themſelues an heauenly wiſedome and vnderſtanding of the Lords will and word. <hi>Get wiſedome</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Prou.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>get vnderſtanding, forget not, neither decline from the words of my
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:173667:87"/>mouth; forſake her not, and ſhe ſhall keepe thee, loue her and ſhe ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue thee. Wiſdome is the beginning, get wiſdome therfore, and aboue all thy poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s get vnderſtanding.</hi> He is very frequent with the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations in many places alſo of the ſame booke. Reade them, I pray, at your leaſure, and marke them well. <hi>Paul</hi> in like manner, writing vnto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> doth ſtir them vp to the ſame duty, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Wherefor be yee not vnwiſe, but vnderſtand what the will of the Lord is. Eph.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo inioined the ſame duty vpon his ſon <hi>Salomon,</hi> towards the end of his dayes, ſaying vnto him as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>My ſonne, know thou the God of thy fathers, and ſerue him with an vpright heart and willing minde,</hi> as it is in 1. <hi>Cron.</hi> 28.9. Finally, the Lord himſelfe doth oftentimes make his moane and complaint for the want of this wiſdome and knowledge in his people, which is here required of vs all, teaching vs thereby how neceſſary it is for euery one, and how well pleaſing to himſelfe. But at this time two places alone (to ſhew the ſame) ſhall content vs. The one is in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1.3. when he ſaith: <hi>The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his maiſters cribbe; but Iſrael hath not knowne, my people haue not vnderſtood.</hi> The other is in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 4.22. where you haue theſe words: <hi>For my people is fooliſh, they haue not knowne me, they are fooliſh children, and haue no vnderſtanding, they are wiſe to do euill, but to doe well they haue no knowledge.</hi> By all which places we may clearely ſee, what doth belong to vs, euen a ſauing knowledge of Gods will, and an holy vnderſtanding of his waies. <hi>Wee must not be like to the horſe or mule that haue no vnderſtanding</hi> (as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.9) but we muſt be changed by the renewing of our minds, that we may know what is the good, perfect and acceptable will of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach vs in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</p>
            <p>And the reaſons hereof are many.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> Firſt becauſe euery man by his owne knowledge is a very beaſt before the Lord, as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> doth witneſſe of vs, in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 10.14. and as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe of himſelfe, in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 73.22. ſaying: <hi>So fooliſh was I, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, I was a beaſt before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe we ſhall neuer obey the Lord aright, vntill we know him and vnderſtand his will, nor yeeld any faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto him, as it doth become vs. For the ground-worke of all religion, &amp; the foundation of all true pietie, is the knowledge of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:173667:87"/>the Lord and his wayes. As on the contrary ſide, the cauſe and fountaine of all diſobedience againſt God, is the ignorance of his will, and the vnlearnedneſſe of the ſame, as we haue heard in this Pſalme already: and as we may ſee by <hi>Hoſea</hi> his complaint, in the beginning of the fourth chapter of his Propheſie, where hee doth make his moane, that men did <hi>lie,</hi> and <hi>ſteale,</hi> and <hi>commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>that bloud did touch bloud,</hi> and aſſigneth this reaſon of it, euen becauſe there was <hi>no knowledge</hi> of God in the land. And ſurely where men know not God, what can bee looked for elſe, but all impietie againſt God, and all vnrighteous dealing againſt men?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe all ſuch as are ignorant of the Lords will, doe not onely erre while they are here, committing grieuous ſinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but ſhall be damned alſo hereafter for euer. <hi>My people</hi> (ſaith the Lord in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.6.) <hi>are deſtroyed for lacke of knowledge.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſhew in 2. <hi>Theſſ</hi> 1.8. that when Chriſt ſhal come to iudgement, and ſhew himſelfe from heauen with his mightie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in flaming fire, he ſhall <hi>render vengeance vnto them that doe not know God,</hi> which ſhall bee puniſhed with euerlaſting perdition from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. So that if we ponder of all theſe reaſons well, we ſhal eaſily grant, that there is cauſe ſufficient, why euery man ſhould labour and ſtriue, to plant ſome heauenly knowledge within his ſoule, and to become wiſe and learned in the ſtatutes of the Almightie.</p>
            <p>In regard whereof we ſee firſt, in what great fault the world is in. For there is ignorance in euery place. Alas, alas, moſt men know not aright, either that God who hath made them, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, who are made by him. And as for the grounds of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the rules of the Lords worſhip, they are as a ſealed and claſped booke vnto them. We dwell in a nation and country, wherin the word of God hath bene freely read &amp; preached many yeares together: yet it is pittifull to heare &amp; vnderſtand, what ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is ſtill amongſt men, and how vnwiſe &amp; vnlearned they be in the ſtatutes of the Lord. God amend vs. But here ſome may ſay, that there was neuer more knowledge in this land, then now is at this preſent. To this I anſwer, firſt, that our knowledge is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our long and continued teaching. For in regard thereof,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:173667:88"/>we ought to be teachers our ſelues, who yet are taught of others, and haue need alſo to be inſtructed in the very firſt principles of the word of God, and are become (many of vs at the leaſt) ſuch as haue neede of milke, and not of ſtrong meate, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth ſpeake in the latter end of his fifth chapter. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our knowledge (for the moſt part) is not a ſauing, or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying knowledge, but talkatiue and diſcourſing: It hangs vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our tongue, and ſwimmes about in the circumference of our braine; but it ſinkes not downe into the bottome of the heart (as it ought to do) to bring forth a reformed life. For we haue many talkers, but few true walkers: and ſundry there are, who can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at large in matters of religion; but few there are, who feele the power and force thereof, being deaded by the meanes thereof vnto their ſinnes, and quickened vp vnto all fruitfull workes of righteouſneſſe, whereby God may be honoured, and man edified.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by this we may ſee, that that doctrine, which is moſt currant at Rome, &amp; thoſe places where Popery doth beare ſway, to wit, <hi>that Ignorance is the mother of Deuotion,</hi> is moſt falſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and to be abandoned by vs, that are true and holy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. As Chriſt doth ſay to the <hi>Sadduces: Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. making there <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance the cauſe of error,</hi> which is cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to their doctrine: ſo he ſaith to the Iewes: <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which teſtifie of me,</hi> in <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. impoſing there this dutie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all that do intend to be ſaued at the laſt, to be conuerſant in the Scriptures; which is diſſonant altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their practize and teaching. If I would ſtand vpon ſuch a common place as this is, I could alledge both places and reaſons enough to ouerthrow them in this reſpect, who are herein moſt like vnto thoſe curſed and hypocriticall Scribes and Phariſies, who did ſhut vp the kingdome of heauen before men, neither go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, nor ſuffering others that would enter, to come in. But let theſe things thus ſpoken ſuffice, and cauſe vs not onely to ſee their fault, and that woefull miſerie wherein they liue, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to behold the ſweet and great bleſſing of knowledge, which God hath vouchſafed vnto vs, through the happy gouernment
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:173667:88"/>of his Annoynted ouer vs, who doth permit vs to enioy the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell freely for the good of our ſoules, and doth take a care al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the right publiſhing of the ſame; that ſo his ſubiects might not bee ignorant therein, but haue the ſauing knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of eſtabliſhed within them, to their eternall happineſſe, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, out of this we may obſerue, what is our owne duty to do, and that is this: We muſt caſt away our ignorance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come learned in the Lords will; we muſt ſet his ſtatutes before our eyes, and make them the men of our counſell; we muſt call after knowledge, and cry for vnderſtanding. We muſt ſeeke after wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as after ſiluer, and ſearch for her as for treaſures. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians, chap.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>dwell in you plenteouſly in all wiſedome, teaching and admoniſhing your ſelues in Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall ſongs, ſinging with a grace in your hearts vnto the Lord.</hi> Here you ſee, hee would not haue them to content themſelues with a little knowledge, but they muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be furniſhed with a great abundance thereof, that they might know how to carry themſelues in all matters, as well for them of mirth and ioy, as for others that were more graue and weightie. And good reaſon too; for the word of Chriſt muſt bee the ſtone <hi>Ezell</hi> to vs, that we may know where to ſtay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine (as <hi>Dauid</hi> did 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.19.) It muſt be our tinne-ſtone, (ſpoken of in <hi>Zecharie</hi> 4.10.) that we may know the meaſure of the walles of new Ieruſalem, our glorious and renowned Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the foundation whereof is of pearle, and the ſtreets of pure gold. In a word, it muſt be our ſtarre, that we may know which way to go directly vnto all our duties, that are here below, and vnto all thoſe ſweete beatitudes that are aboue. Doubtleſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the true knowledge thereof, we are all of vs like to <hi>Sampſon</hi> without his eyes, or vnto an hawke that is hooded: we ſhall wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Lord we know not whither, and commit moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous abhominations; but we ſhall neuer ſerue him aright, or doe any faithfull homage vnto him. For onely thoſe that know his name do truſt in him, but others do renounce him, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do teach vs. Knowledge (we finde by experience) doth helpe men exceeding much in the waies of eternall life. For it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:173667:89"/>doth direct them aright both what to iudge, and what to do in all matters of ſaith and maners, and it is a good bridle vnto their luſts. It is moſt like vnto a clocke, whereby thou maieſt know how thy life is ſpent; as alſo vnto a man, which ſtriueth to beate the duſt out of our cloathing.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I beſeech you, and that in the bowels of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, haue a care of knowledge, and labour by all meanes poſſible to plant a ſauing wiſedome within your hearts. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the reaſons that were alledged before, to moue your ſelues to this, thinke oftentimes vpon them; and if neither your owne beaſtlineſſe by nature, who haue groſſe and thicke ſcales of blindneſſe vpon the eies of your ſoules, as <hi>Paul</hi> had vpon the eyes of his body at the time of his conuerſion, can ſtirre you; nor yet the commodities that comes by the knowledge of the Lords will, which are ſweete and great, can awaken you; yet (yet I ſay) let the feare of your owne damnation rouze you vp hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For it is a moſt wofull thing to lye burning in hell, and yet (as it hath bene obſerued) all ignorant perſons do ſo. Suppoſe here were a fire prepared to burne you, and to morrow you muſt be caſt into the ſame, and there lye burning, peece after peece, till all be conſumed; would not you doe any thing which any man ſhould command you to do, to auoyde this puniſhment? O yes, any thing I doubt not. And yet will you do nothing to auoyde hell fire, which is tenthouſand times worſe then this, where you ſhall lye burning body and ſoule for euermore? Shall not this moue you vp to get knowledge and vnderſtanding? If you were blinde in body, you would giue great ſummes of money to haue your perfect ſight againe. And yet will you doe nothing for the ſight of the ſoule, which is blinde, and can ſee nothing at all? Will you take no paines to haue that couering that couereth all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that veile that is ſpred ouer all nations, to be remoued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you, that you may be troubled no more with it? Darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was one of the greateſt plagues which God brought vpon Aegypt. But as for the darkneſſe of the ſoule, that is worſe then that by many degrees. For as this doth hinder the iudgement (which as an eye ſhould guide our actions) from diſcerning things fit to be done, and fit to bee vndone; and as it doth let our hearts
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:173667:89"/>and minds from going and walking about our workes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that we cannot paſſe through the ſweete fields of true comforts and heauenly meditations to life eternall: ſo it doth make vs fall oftentimes into moſt horrible ſins while we are here, and it doth caſt vs downe at the laſt into the bottomleſſe pit of hell (wherehence we can neuer come out againe) ſo ſoone as we doe depart from hence. And will you then reſt in it, and not ſeeke rather to come out of it? What? could <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (that wicked King) vſe meanes to come out of that bodily darkneſſe wherein he was, by ſending vnto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for that end and purpoſe, &amp; by offering vnto them a certaine kinde of libertie to depart out of his country? And will you ſit ſtill, and not vſe meanes to come out of the ſpirituall darkneſſe wherein you are, which is farre worſe then that of his was? Remember your ſelues, I pray, and do as you ought to do.</p>
            <p>But here ſome man may ſay,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
               </label> that it is better for vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill in our ignorance, then to get knowledge vnto our ſelues, becauſe ignorance doth excuſe men before God; and the more knowledge that any man hath, the greater ſhall his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be at the laſt, if he ſerue not God according to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as hee ought to do. <hi>For the ſeruant</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47.) <hi>that knoweth his maisters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> yea with more then he that knew it not, and did it not.</p>
            <p>Here is a goodly ſhift for men to coſen their owne ſoules by.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> But know thou (ô ſinfull man) firſt, that ignorance doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe men before God, but rather accuſe them (as all other ſinnes do) and lay matter of condemnation againſt them, to their eternall woe and death: for it is a grieuous tranſgreſſion in his ſight, and vnleſſe it be pardoned by the ſacrifice of his Sonne (which was figured out by thoſe ſacrifices which were offered vnder the Law for the ſinnes of ignorance) it will damne them in hell for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and keepe them there in flames of fire that cannot be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as thou heardſt in effect before. Indeed in ſome caſes igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth excuſe men in part, from the greatneſſe of the fault, but not in whole, from all the fault. Secondly, that though he ſhall be beaten with more ſtripes, that knoweth the Lords will,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:173667:90"/>and doth it not yet the other which is ignorant of it, ſhall be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ſtripes, and he alſo ſhall be caſt into hell, as well as the former; howbeit his iudgement there ſhall not be altogether ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere as his. And wilt thou willingly be beaten with any ſtripes, and go to that fearefull and euer-tormenting place? Laſtly, that ſome ignorance doth increaſe a mans fault, and make his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the more cruell at the laſt, to wit, that ignorance, which is wilfull and affected: as when a man hath meanes to know the Lords will, and yet doth refuſe it of wilfulneſſe, or ſtubburnneſſe, euen becauſe he will be ignorant ſtill, and not haue knowledge to controll him in his ſinnes, or to ſtand vp as a Iudge againſt him in the end of the world, when the bookes of mens conſciences ſhall be opened, and euery one iudged according to the things which are written therein; for this doth make him to be the more abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable before the Lord, and doth procure vnto him the heauier plagues to be executed vpon him. I will ſhew this vnto thee by a familiar example, taken euen from thy ſelfe. Thou haſt two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, the one of them doth reuerently hearken vnto thee, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thy will, and pleaſure; and he is content to learne it to the vttermoſt, but yet he will do nothing accordingly: the other doth ſo far ſcorne thee and thy worke, that as he will do nothing for thee, nor according to thy mind, ſo he will not come into thy preſence to heare what thou wilt ſay vnto him, or ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, will giue no heede to thy words. Which of theſe two (I pray thee) is the worſe, and the viler in thine eyes? and which of them wilt thou beate moſt? Is not the latter? Yes, I muſt needs confeſſe that, wilt thou ſay; for he doth commit a double fault, he will neither heare nor do; but the other doth commit but a ſingle fault: though he will do nothing, yet he is content to heare. So, euen ſo, muſt thou iudge of moſt ignorant perſons, who do liue now in our dayes. For they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit a double ſin, in that they will neither learne the will of God, nor do it; wheras others co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit but a ſingle ſin, in that they only neglect it, &amp; not do it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, they are moſt abhominable before the Lord, and ſhall at the laſt be beaten of him with more ſtripes, then others ſhall be. Wherfore let this be no impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to thee, but rather a ſpur in thy ſide, to prick thee forward, to get knowledge and vnderſtanding.</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:173667:90"/>
            <p> But what courſe ſhall I take, maiſt thou ſay, to attaine vnto it? Thou muſt performe theſe things, Firſt, thou muſt pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the Lord, to intreate him to diſcloſe his minde vnto thee, and ſo to circumciſe thine eares and heart, that thou maiſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his will, and ſee the wonders of his law. For wiſedome comes by prayer, as <hi>Iames</hi> doth ſhew, in chapter 1.5. ſaying: <hi>If any of you lacke wiſedome, let him aske of God, which giueth to all men liberally, and reprocheth no man; and it ſhall be giuen him.</hi> Secondly thou muſt regard the Miniſtery of the word moſt reuerently, and frequent alwaies the holy exerciſes thereof, <hi>watching daily</hi> (as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> doth ſpeake, in <hi>Prouerbes</hi> 8.33.) <hi>at the gates of Wiſedome, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of her doores.</hi> For this is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes to beget, and to increaſe knowledge within vs; as <hi>Paul</hi> doth well obſerue in many places of his Epiſtles, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fourth chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> &amp; as we our ſelues do find to be moſt true by our daily experience, both in our ſelues and others. Thirdly, thou muſt meditate carefully with thy ſelfe both day and night in the law and word of thy God. For as the infant doth grow from ſtrength to ſtrength, to be able to go by it ſelfe, by ſucking and plucking his mothers breaſts: ſo doth the child of God grow from knowledge to knowledge, by han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging continually vpon the two breaſts of the Lords booke, the old and new Teſtament. Fourthly, thou muſt conferre and talke conſiderately with men of GOd, and with ſuch as cary knowledge in their lippes, and are able to diſcouer vnto thee the ſecrets of the Almighty. For they ſhall make thee to vnderſtand that, which thou couldſt neuer attaine vnto by thy ſelfe, and cauſe thee to ſee thoſe points after ſome cleare and euident manner, which were before vnto thee as dark as a riddle it ſelfe; as thou maiſt ſee by the example of <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch ſpoken of in the eight chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles. Fiftly, thou muſt teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers circumſpectly that which thou thy ſelfe doſt know already, and rehearſe the waies of the Lord euermore vnto them. For by teaching another, a man doth teach himſelfe, and ripen his owne knowledge and iudgement exceeding much, as many by their owne practiſe haue found it to be moſt true, to the great ioy and comfort of their ſoules. Finally, thou muſt abſtaine moſt proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:173667:91"/>from all ſuch things, as will hinder thy knowledge, and bring a ſpirituall darkneſſe vpon thee. For as he that would haue a perfect ſight, to behold all things clearely, muſt beware of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing, which will blemiſh his eye: ſo all thoſe that would haue a good vnderſtanding in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels of the moſt High, muſt take heed of all ſuch matters, as are a ſtop and impediment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. Now theſe are in number chiefly three. The firſt is a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the affections of the heart, and the cogitations of the minde vpon this world: for as outward darkneſſe groweth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by two much gazing vpon bright and gliſtering things, as in experience we finde by white ſnow, white paper, and the like: ſo doth inward darkeneſſe grow alſo by fixing the minde too much vpon the gliſtering glory of this world, the pompes and pleaſures that ſhine in it. Proofe hereof is that rich glutton, that wealthy Barne-builder in the Goſpell, and that turne-coate <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh: who all were blind (you plainly ſee) with gazing too much vpon this tempting world. The ſecond is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing in euil, &amp; a doing of things which are wicked &amp; naught. For as outward darkneſſe groweth by long being in darkeneſſe, as in a priſon or elſewhere; (for by experience it is found ſo often) ſo by long cuſtome of walking &amp; liuing in the outward works of darkenes, groweth a ſtrong &amp; thicke inward darkenes in the heart of man or woman, Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof is <hi>Ahab, Cain, Herod, Iudas,</hi> and ſuch like ſpoken of in the Scriptures, and too many in our daies, who hauing long vſed ſwearing, lying, vncleaneneſſe, and ſome other vices, are growne ſo blind in them, that they neither will leaue them, neither be perſwaded, that they tend ſo to their deſtruction, as they do. The third and laſt is, greedineſſe after the world, and the commodities thereof. For as outward darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe groweth now and then by ouermuch heate, as we know, the hote dung falling into our eyes will hurt them, as it is ſaid it did <hi>Tobies:</hi> ſo ouer-hote deſire of gaine hurteth the inward light, as is apparent, both by that which hath bene ſaid already touching the world, and by that alſo which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>They that will be rich fall into temptations, and into many fooliſh and noiſome luſts, which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. For this is a kind of peſtilent heat within, which as powerfully thruſteth out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:173667:91"/>eye and light of the minde, as euer any outward heate did the eye of the body. Now of all theſe muſt we take heede, and voide them. Thus thou haſt ſhortly the things which thou muſt performe for the getting of knowledge. To conclude therefore, looke well vnto them, and with care and conſcience do thou vſe them: and no doubt but thou ſhalt become wiſe and learned, and do that which is here required at thine hands.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Prophet hauing ſpoken in the former verſe, of the firſt part of repentance: he comes now in theſe verſes to ſpeake of the latter part thereof. As he would haue the Kings and Iudges in the firſt place to get vnto themſelues wiſedome and learning: ſo he would haue them in the ſecond place to become ſubiect and obedient, and ſo to carry themſelues in the whole courſe of their liues, as they ought to do. Firſt towards God the Father in the eleuenth verſe; then towards God the Sonne in the twelth verſe. For ſeeing they had before rebelled againſt them both, he would haue them now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in all ſubmiſſion vnto them both. To the Father they muſt performe theſe duties. They muſt ſerue and worſhip him; and whereas without feare, they cannot but faile in many points, which do belong vnto him; they muſt feare and reuerence him in their hearts, being moſt willing at all times to do his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; moſt vnwilling to offend him in any thing whatſoeuer. Moreouer conſidering he is a God moſt louing and bountifull to all ſuch as are vnder him, and do truly belong vnto him, they muſt reioyce and be glad in him, and triumph (as it were) againe in his praiſe and honour. Yet foraſmuch as he is one withall, full of Maieſtie, and hath iudgements enough in ſtore to powre downe vpon them that are proud and arrogant, they muſt be humble and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:173667:92"/>lowly, and euen tremble &amp; quake before him. Now to the Son, this is that which they muſt do. They muſt in like manner adore and worſhip him, and in token of their true loue and loyall ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto him, they muſt go vnto him, and kiſſe him. And leſt they ſhould be ſlacke or backeward herein, the Prophet moues them vp to this their duty by ſtrong and forcible reaſons. For firſt he ſets down before their eyes the great inconueniences which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe will fall out vnto them vpon the neglect or contempt thereof. For thereby it will come to paſſe, that the Sonne will not onely be angry, and much offended with them for it, but alſo in his anger and great diſpleaſure will bring great iudgements vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; which ſhall conſume them, and that in the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can bring their purpoſes to paſſe; yea though he burne but a little, and therefore much more will he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, when he ſhall throughly take on againſt them. Then ſecond, he ſhewes them what benefite they ſhall haue if they will performe it, and do as he would haue them do; for then they ſhall be bleſſed, and haue ioyes and happeneſſe for euermore, though others periſh and are deſtroyed. For <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are all that truſt in him.</hi> And ſo with this Epiphoneme or graue ſentence, he ſhuts vp the whole Pſalme and ends it.</p>
            <p>In ſumme,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Summe. </seg>
               </label> you haue nothing elſe to remember in theſe two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but the ſubiection or obedience, which we owe vnto the Lord our God. Wherein conſider firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>
               </label> what we muſt do towards God the Father, ſet downe in the eleuenth verſe; then what we muſt do towards God the Sonne, ſet downe in the twelfth verſe. In regard of God the Father two things are required of vs. The firſt is, that we ſerue him in feare; the ſecond is, that we reioyce before him in trembling: for thus we may deuide it if we will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that diuiſion which ſeemes to be made in the text it ſelfe; for there (you know) it lyeth thus: <hi>Serue the Lord in feare, and reioyce in trembling,</hi> as though there were but two brances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in it. But yet if you would go more plainly to worke, there are foure things exacted of vs. The firſt is that we ſerue the Lord; the ſecond is, that we feare the Lord; the third is, that we reioyce in the Lord; and the fourth is, that we tremble before the Lord. The former of theſe ſeemes to import the worſhip and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:173667:93"/>honour it ſelfe, which is due vnto him; and the three latter the manner how it muſt be yeelded vnto him. And that is firſt, in feare, as the fountaine from whence it muſt proceed; then ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ioy and trembling, as the hands by which it muſt be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him. Of all theſe by Gods grace I will ſpeake ſomewhat, and that in order as they lie in our text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Serue the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, that is, giue vnto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his due honour and worſhip, which hitherto you haue kept from him; diſobey him no longer, but ſubmit your ſelues vnto him in all obedience to his will, and fulfill his commandements. For by the name of <hi>the Lord,</hi> here is vnderſtood God the Father, as it was in the fourth and ſeuenth verſes of this Pſalme before going: and vnder the word <hi>ſeruice,</hi> is compriſed all that honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which doth belong vnto him in the whole courſe of our liues, and which doth chiefly ſtand in the obeying of his voyce, and in the keeping of his commandements.</p>
            <p>In this,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that the Prophet doth exact this duty of them, we are taught this doctrine, that men muſt ſerue and worſhip the Lord, and be carefull euermore to obey his will, and to do whatſoeuer he ſhall command them. Our Sauiour in <hi>Mathew</hi> doth inſtruct vs as much in the fourth chapter thereof, and tenth verſe, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the temptation of the diuell, who ſought to be worſhipped of him, he ſaid vnto him: <hi>Auoide Sathan, for it is written; Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full of this matter, but one place more, as containing all the reſt vnder it, ſhall ſuffice vs at this time. And that is in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14.7. For there you ſhall find, that this is the very ſumme and principall matter, whereof the whole Scripture doth intreate, and which all the Preachers in the world from time to time do deliuer vnto their people; when the Angell flying in the midſt of heauen, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an euerlaſting Goſpell, to preach vnto them, that dwell on the earth, doth cry out and ſay: <hi>Feare God, and giue glory to him, for the houre of his iudgement is come, and worſhip him that made heauen and earth, and the ſea, and the fountaines of waters.</hi> So that this is a point as cleare and manifeſt as the Sunne at noone dayes, when it ſhineth moſt brightly ouer all the word.</p>
            <p>And the reaſons hereof are many,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſones </seg>
               </label> but at this time I will onely
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:173667:93"/>touch two. The one is in regard of his making and creating of all things. For ſeeing we are his workmanſhip, and haue our whole liues and being from him, he hauing created vs and made vs of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; it is good reaſon, that we apply our ſelues, and all that we haue to his worſhip and ſeruice alone; according to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church triumphing in heauen, whereof mention is made in the <hi>Reuelations</hi> Chapter 4. verſes 10.11. For the 24. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (noting out the Saints in heauen) are there reported to fall downe before him that ſate on the throne, and to worſhip him that liueth for euermore, and to caſt their Crownes before his throne, vpon this ground and conſideration, that he had made them, and all things elſe, ſaying: <hi>Thou ort worthy, O Lord, to receiue glory, and honour, and power. For thou haſt created all things, and for thy wils ſake they are and haue bene created.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other is in regard of his preſeruing, and keeping of all things. For conſidering that we haue our whole maintenance and ſtay from him, and he doth daily keepe vs vpon his owne coſt and charges (as we ſpeake:) it is our part and duty to honour him, and to do whatſoeuer we can for him in fulfilling any of his Commandements, according to <hi>Ioſuah</hi> his exhortation vnto the children of Iſrael in the 23. &amp; 24. chapters of <hi>Ioſuah.</hi> For in theſe places you may ſee, that he doth perſwade them to feare the Lord, and to ſerue him in vprightneſſe and in truth, and to put away all falſe gods from amongſt them, onely vpon this reaſon and foundation, that God was good and beneficiall vnto them, deſtroying all their enimies before them, and placing them in a fruitfull country, where they had goodly cities, which they did neuer build; excellent vineyards and Oliue trees, which they did neuer plant; and other notable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which they did daily enioy without any labour and toile of theirs. And ſurely when theſe things were thus lay de downe before their eyes, they alſo vpon the due conſideration thereof, reſolued with themſelues, to ſerue the Lord and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and to do as <hi>Ioſuah</hi> had exhorted them for to do, as is apparant about the midſt of the 24. chapter before quoted. And you know, that equitie and conſcience doth require, that if a man hire a ſeruant, and giue him meate and drinke and wages, that he ſhould do his buſineſſe, and be obedient vnto him, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:173667:94"/>And ſo ſhould it be betwixt God and vs, ſeeing we are his ſeruants, and haue all that we haue from him, euen euery morſell of meate that we do eate, and euery peece of cloth that we do put about vs, as all other things beſides; we ſhould be tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his voyce, and be alwayes ready preſt to do his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as this may controll them,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> who are ſtubburne and obſtinate, and do withdraw the ſhoulder from yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the Almightie; whereof there are too many in our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dayes: So it may teach vs, what we our ſelues ought to do, and be as a ſpurre in our ſides to pricke vs forward to all ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as may bring honor and glory vnto him that is aboue all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware you, beware you of ſinfull wayes, and be you ſure to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what you know will be well pleaſing vnto your God. Though others lie, and ſweare, and ſteale, and kill, and commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, and do other things that are moſt vile and abhominable; yet be you holy &amp; righteous in your wayes, auoiding theſe ſinnes, and all others whatſoeuer; and performing ſuch duties only as the Lord will be ſerued and worſhipped by. For you muſt alwayes remember with your ſelues, that it is not enough to know the will of your God, and to vnderſtand what he doth require at your hands, but you muſt withall ſerue him and worſhip him aright, &amp; do according to his commandements. <hi>The hearers of the law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law ſhall be iuſtified.</hi> And our Sauiour doth teach vs, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47. that <hi>the ſeruant who knoweth his maiſters will, and prepareth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, neither doth according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Yea, you your ſelues do know, that as the ignorant, who know not the Lord, muſt be caſt into hell, and there lie boyling in torments for euermore; ſo muſt the diſobedient alſo, and all ſuch who obey not vnto the Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> words in 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. And therfore, you ſee, the Prophet here doth not onely call for wiſedome, and learning, but alſo for worſhip &amp; ſeruice. Content not then your ſelues with your knowledge and vnderſtanding, but go on forward, and become faithfull ſeruants vnto the Lord in doing his will. And looke what you do require of your ſeruants that are vnder you, do you your ſelues performe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:173667:94"/>vnto your God that is aboue you, and whoſe ſeruants you are: heare his voyce and obey it. For what? ſhall he make you, and place you here in this world, and that in a fruitfull ſoile, &amp; in the dayes of much peace and plentie? and yet will you not ſerue him? What? Shall he nouriſh you daily, giue you light to ſee, aire to breathe in, food to eate, liquor to drinke, garments to weare, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to dwell in, and lade you with other infinite bleſſings, both for this life, and the life to come? and yet will you not honour him, and walke according to his commandements? Doubtleſſe, if your ſeruants ſhould refuſe to do your buſineſſe and worke, you would turne them out of doores, and not feed them vpon your owne coſt and charges, and in the end pay them their wages; and will God then take it well at your hands, if you ſhall refuſe to do his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and worke? will he alwayes then nouriſh you, and giue you a good recompence at the laſt? No, no: but he will turne you out of houſe and home, and pay you your wages (according to your euill deſerts) in that lake that burneth with brimſtone and fire, where you ſhall be tormented for euermore. For you know, that euery tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, muſt be hewen downe, and caſt into the fire, according to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſts words in the third of <hi>Mathew,</hi> and the tenth verſe thereof. For as you your ſelues, after you haue taken ſome paines, and beſtowed ſome coſt in the planting of an orchard, do looke that the ſame orchard ſhould bring forth fruit, not for other men, but for your ſelues, &amp; your owne vſes; and if it happen, that any trees therein do waxe barren and fruitleſſe, you will cut them downe, and not ſuffer them there to remaine: So you muſt thinke, that the Lord will deale with you. Behold, you are his orchard and vineyard, he hath taken great paines with you, and hath bene as it were at great coſt and charges to plant you (as he ſpeakes of Iſrael in the fifth of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the beginning thereof;) and he lookes that you ſhould bring forth fruit, not to your ſelues, or to the world, or to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, but to the honour and praiſe of his name. Now then, if you ſhall be barren, or bring forth wild fruit much diſpleaſing vnto his Maieſtie, aſſure your owne ſoules, that he will not ſpare you, but cut you downe, and not ſuffer you to grow in his orchard ſtill; as our Sauiour doth moſt excellently declare, by the parable of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:173667:95"/>the figge-tree, in the 13. chapter of the Goſpel according to Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and about the beginning thereof. Wherefore, I beſeech you, ſerue ye the Lord your God, and worſhip him; be obedient vnto his voyce, and let no commandement of his ſeeme grieuous or irkeſome vnto you, but endeuor you to obſerue and keepe them all. And as he that hath called you out of darkneſſe into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous light, is holy, ſo be you holy in all manner of conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, knowing that we are deliuered out of the hands of our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to this end, that we ſhould ſerue the Lord without feare, all the dayes of our life, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74.75. And therefore in one word, ſubmit your ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Almightie at all times, and in all matters, and do as <hi>Iames</hi> doth will vs for to do, when he ſaith, <hi>Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers onely, deceiuing your owne ſelues.</hi> Iam. 1.22.</p>
            <p>Thus farre ſhortly for the worſhip or ſeruice it ſelfe, which doth belong to God the Father: now followeth the maner how it muſt be yeelded vnto him. For as God doth reſpect the matter of euery worke, ſo he hath an eye alſo vnto the maner of the ſame, as you may ſee moſt euidently by the ſtory of the Scriptures, and namely by the firſt chapter of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the ſixth chapter of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew:</hi> where you may finde, that he doth euen loathe and reiect almes, faſtings, prayers, ſacrifices, and other holy duties, which are commanded by his owne Maieſtie; for that they are not done in the ſame manner, as they ought to be. Note it (I pray) well by the way, and make vſe thereof to your ſelues, that in all your wayes you may not onely looke, that the worke it ſelfe, which you go about, be correſpondent to the will of your God; but alſo beſure, that you do it with that holy mind and affection in euerie reſpect, as it ought to be done both by you and others. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that here are three things required of vs by name in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Lord, as noting out the right manner how it muſt be exhibited vnto him, namely feare, ioy and trembling; labour you to haue them all eſtabliſhed within your owne ſoules, and reſt not till they be rooted there within you. For they will do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much good, and fit you euery way vnto your duties. The firſt of them, which is feare, will make you carefull of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and cauſe you to faile in none of them. The
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:173667:95"/>ſecond of them, which is ioy, will make you conſtant and ſtable, and cauſe you neuer to be weary of well doing. For the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that a man doth take in a thing, the more willing is he for to do it, and it is a kind of death vnto him to be abridged from it. The third and laſt of them, which is trembling, will make you humble and lowly, and cauſe you neuer to ſwell for any good which you ſhall euer do. For he that doth tremble doth ſuſpect his owne workes, and dare not truſt in them, but doth ſeare leſt ſome iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will fall vpon him for ſome defects therein. Thus in a word or two I paſſe ouer the manner of Gods worſhip, as being a thing not ſo cleare in it ſelfe, but ſomewhat queſtionable, whether, to wit, it be agreeable to the ſpirit of God in the text or no; for ſome may doubt thereof. But yet on the points themſelues I will ſtand more largely vpon, as on matters which are moſt euident, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all queſtion and doubt whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>The firſt of them is feare. <hi>In feare,</hi> ſaith the text, or after ſome, with reuerence; both come almoſt to one end, but the former word is the better of the two: and he meanes the feare of his children, who are loath to offend him, not ſo much for feare of puniſhment, as for loathſomneſſe on their part of loue to diſpleaſe his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, or to cauſe him to be angry with them for any thing. There is a two-fold feare, the one is holy and good, called filiall or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh; the other is bad and naught, termed ſeruile or ſlauiſh. The filiall or childiſh feare is ſuch an one, as is in children towards their parents, who do reuerence and feare them, as being vnwilling to offend them any way, whether by words, or deeds, through the tender loue and affection, which they do beare towards them. The ſeruile or ſlauiſh feare is ſuch an one as is in bond-ſlaues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their maiſters, who do reuerence and feare them, and are loath to diſpleaſe them whether one way or other, through the dread and feare of puniſhment, which otherwiſe they are ſure to haue, if they offend and do contrary to their duties. So that ſome do feare the Lord through loue, and care to offend him; and others againe do feare him through dread of puniſhment, and power to torment them. Of the former of theſe is mention here made, &amp; not of the latter. It may be defined thus: It is a reuerence of Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie in our hearts, whereby we are made vnwilling to offend him
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:173667:96"/>in any thing, and moſt willing to pleaſe him in all things, through the loue which we beare towards him, and the great excellency of ſuperioritie, dignity, power, and goodneſſe, which we ſee in him, farre aboue our ſelues, and all other creatures beſides. This is a vertue moſt neceſſary, and requiſite for all Chriſtians whatſoeuer. For hereupon hang the whole ſeruice of God, and all graces that belong to man, as might at large be ſhewed, if it were needfull. But let the Example of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuffiſe, who thinking that the feare of God was not in <hi>Gerar,</hi> vtterly deſpaired of any other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and therefore moued his wife to ſay, that ſhe was his ſiſter. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.11. In this reſpect the feare of God is both by <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.10. and alſo by <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.7. called the beginning of wiſedome, that is, the roote and fountaine of all goodneſſe, and therefore of the whole worſhip and ſeruice of God ſpoken of here in this place. So that there is good cauſe, why the Prophet ſhould require of vs, to ſerue the Lord with feare. Where-hence let vs collect this doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that as we muſt ſerue the Lord, ſo we muſt feare the Lord, and ſtand in great awe and reuerence of him. <hi>Thou ſhalt feare</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13.) <hi>the Lord thy God, and ſerue him, and ſhalt ſweare by his name. Eſay</hi> doth require the ſame duty of his people in chapter 8.13. when he ſaith vnto them: <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of hoaſts, and let him be your feare, and let him be your dread.</hi> But to paſſe other places, marke what <hi>Salomon</hi> doth ſay of this in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Let vs heare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the end of all, feare God, and keepe his Commandements; for this is the whole duty of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are diuerſe reaſons to moue vs hereunto.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> As firſt the greatneſſe of his power and might aboue vs. Secondly, his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and iuriſdiction, which he hath ouer vs. Thirdly, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy which he doth ſhew vnto vs. Fourthly, his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and glory, which doth ſhine and gliſter round about vs. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his puritie and holineſſe, that is in his eyes beholding vs. And laſtly, the great bleſſings, which the feare it ſelfe being had, will bring vnto vs. For all theſe things may iuſtly worke a feare in men. Meane men (we find by experience) do feare great men, &amp; thoſe that are too mighty for them, and they dare not in any caſe diſpleaſe them. Children feare their parents, and ſuch as haue a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tuition ouer them. Workemen feare their maiſters by whom
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:173667:96"/>they liue and are maintained; and looke who are moſt bountifull and prodigall vnto them, to them againe do they become moſt obſeruant and obſequious, as being afraid to offend them in any thing. Simple perſons feare great ſtates, &amp; ſuch as excel in glory &amp; maieſtie aboue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>felues, though other wiſe they owe no homage or ſubiection vnto them. Looſe liuers and wantons feare graue &amp; religious perſons, and ſuch as are zealous for Gods glory, &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for the ſaluation of mans ſoule, as being aſhamed to powre out their euil words, or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit their wicked facts before them &amp; in their preſence. Laſtly, euery one by nature is forward to apply himſelfe to thoſe things, which he doth know will bring great profit, and benefit vnto himſelfe, as being deſirous to be out of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and to liue in happineſſe and proſperity all the dayes of his life. Now to apply this to God &amp; to our ſelues; firſt, he is of power and might, we are no body vnto him in that reſpect; he is able to pay vs home, if we do diſpleaſe him. This reaſon our Sauiour doth vrge in <hi>Math.</hi> 10.28. when he wils his Apoſtles not to feare men, who can kil but the body, but to feare the Lord, who is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both body and ſoule in hell. Secondly, he hath authority &amp; iuriſdiction ouer vs, we are his, he hath made vs, and he may do with vs what he will, as the potter doth with his veſſell, or as the maſter doth with his ſeruant. This reaſon the Lord himſelfe doth preſſe in <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.6. ſaying, <hi>A ſon honoreth his father, and aſeruant his maiſter. If then I be a father, where is mine honor? &amp; if I be a maſter, where is my feare? ſaith the Lord of hoſts vnto you, ô Prieſts, that deſpiſe my name.</hi> Thirdly, he is good and kind to vs, his benefites which we do enioy from him, are infinite, we haue all that we haue from him, euen our liues and all the reſt. This reaſon <hi>Dauid</hi> doth touch in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. when he ſaith vnto the Lord, <hi>But mercy is with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> Fourthly, he is a God of infinite Maieſty, and we are but poore ſimple creatures, made of the duſt and clay of the ground; the heauen of heauens cannot containe him, neither can the Angels themſelues ſtand before him for his brightneſſe, vnleſſe they couer their faces with two of their wings. This reaſon doth <hi>Moſes</hi> glance at in <hi>Exodus</hi> 20.20. when he ſhewes the end, wherefore the Lord did publiſh his law in that glorious and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall maner as he did, in thunders, lightnings, and the like, ſaying:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:173667:97"/>
               <hi>For God is come to proue you, and that his feare may be before you, that ye ſinne not.</hi> Fifthly, he is holy and righteous, his eyes are pure eyes, and cannot abide to behold ſinne and iniquity. This reaſon is laid downe before the eyes of the Iſraelites oftentimes in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament by the Spirit of God, when he would draw them to the true feare and ſeruice of the Almighty, from all ſuch manners as were found among the Gentiles. For then ſtill his holineſſe and puritie was enforced vpon them. Finally, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, which the feare of the Lord being once had, wil bring vnto vs, are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding large and great. For firſt, it will make vs holy and frameable vnto Gods will, in auoiding thoſe things which he hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in performing thoſe things, which he hath commanded. <hi>The feare of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.13.) <hi>is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euill way.</hi> Where he ſheweth, that in what meaſure any one feareth God, in the ſame meaſure, he doth loath and deteſt all euill; yea not onely the open &amp; abhominable ſinnes, which the world doth condemne, but the moſt ſecret and hidden. For he ſaith not, to hate euill, as murther and adultery, but pride &amp; arrogancy, which lie in the heart, and do not ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the world, yet he that feareth God, will hate them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it wil make vs bleſſed and happy in all our wayes. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.1.) <hi>is euery one, that feareth the Lord, and walketh in his wayes.</hi> This reaſon the ſweet Singer of Iſrael hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.9. when he ſaith, <hi>Feare the Lord, ye his Saints, for nothing wanteth in them that feare him:</hi> nothing he meanes, which is good and wholeſome for them, as he ſpeakes elſewhere, ſaying: <hi>The Lord will giue grace and glorie, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walke vprightly.</hi> Pſal. 84.17. So that the feare of the Lord brings with it alwayes a plentie of all good things, &amp; comes laden with the bleſſings of God, wherſoeuer it comes. For all theſe cauſes now rehearſed ſhould we feare the Lord, and in reuerence endeuor to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>The vſe that we muſt make of this,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> is firſt, to condemne thoſe that haue not the true feare of the Lord before their eies. Alas their caſe is miſerable. For they ſerue not the true and liuing God, what ſhew of religion ſoeuer they do make, or what brags ſoeuer they do giue forth concerning the ſame. For ſeeing the feare of God is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:173667:97"/>the very beginning of wiſedome, and the ſoundation or ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill of Gods worſhip (as hath bene proued vnto you already,) it is vnpoſſible, that either they ſhould haue any true wiſedome in them, or elſe religiouſly ſhould ſerue the Lord, when they want this feare, the only cauſe and fountaine thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this may ſerue to ſtirre vs vp to get the feare of the Lord vnto our ſelues, and to labor by all meanes poſſible to bring our hearts thereunto, that ſo we may truly ſay of our ſelues, that the Lord is our feare and our dread. But againſt this it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
               </label> firſt, that perfect loue doth caſt out feare, according to <hi>Iohns</hi> words, in 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.18. Secondly, that we are deliuered from our enimies, that we ſhould ſerue the Lord without feare, as it is in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. To this I anſwer,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> that perfect loue doth caſt out hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh feare, and that ſlauiſh or ſeruile one, whereof we ſpake before, that makes man to tremble before God for feare of puniſhment, and to flie from him, as from a terrible Iudge; but on the contrary ſide it cauſeth that holy and childiſh feare (mentioned alſo before) that makes man more carefull to come vnto him, and to worſhip him as he ought to do. From the former of theſe we are deliuered, but not from the latter. <hi>We haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.) <hi>to feare againe, but the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abbah, Father.</hi> So that true loue is ſo farre off from caſting out this holy feare of adoption, or reuerence, whereby we are drawne to hate ſinne in loue towards God, and not for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſake; that it doth bring it in, and eſtabliſh it within vs. Yet this is to be noted by the way, that ſeruile feare is a good meanes at the firſt to bring vs vnto God. For it prepareth a place for the holy Ghoſt to bring him into our ſoules, as the briſtle bringeth in the thrid: but when he is once entred into vs, and hath taken vp the poſſeſſion of our ſoules within vs; then this feare is gone, as the briſtle is when the thrid is entred into the hole. Beſides this you muſt marke, that as the children of God are not by and by perfect, ſo a peece of this feare may ſtill remaine in them: wherupon ſome make a feare, which is in the midſt of theſe two feares, the filiall and ſeruile, calling it <hi>timor initialis, an entring feare,</hi> reaching out her right hand vnto the one, and her left hand vnto the other, being found euen in men renued by the Spirit of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:173667:98"/>loue, whoſe ſanctification is but begun; and therefore as they feare ſeparation from God by offence, which belongeth vnto filiall feare, and proceedeth from loue: ſo they feare puniſhments and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, which God hath prepared for the offendors; which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to ſeruile feare, and proceedeth from the ſame. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on, the feare that is here required of vs, and which is to laſt for euer, is that feare of reuerence, whereby we beholding on the one ſide our owne paruitie and ſmalneſſe, and the excellency of our God, and his incomprehenſible Maieſtie on the other ſide, dare not lift vp our ſelues againſt him, but do ſtand in awe of him with all reuerence, being loath to offend him in any thing, and moſt carefull to pleaſe him in all things. It is ſuch a feare as is in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing children towards their parents, in dutifull wiues towards their husbands, and in faithful ſubiects towards their Princes. The fountaine whereof is loue, and a due conſideration of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency euery way aboue vs. To this feare muſt we ſtirre vp our ſoules euery day. And ſo farre as we would either worſhip God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, or haue his bleſſings powred downe vpon vs (whether for this life, or the life to come) we muſt ſtriue and contend with our ſoules and hearts to bring them hereunto, that ſo we may alwayes reuerence and dread the great name of the Lord of hoſts. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we ſhall nener ſerue the Lord aright, or become happie and bleſſed, vntill this be brought to paſſe. Well we may performe ſome duties in outward appearance, but we ſhal neuer looke to all with a good heart and conſcience within: and howſoeuer we proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and flouriſh for a while, yet woe and deſtruction will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take vs at the laſt. But let his feare be once planted within vs, then ſhall we inwardly and from the heart, haue a reſpect vnto all his commandements, and be moſt carefull to pleaſe him in all things. And then againe ſhall we proſper and flouriſh for euer, not only in this world, but much more in the world to come. If any then ſhall come vnto vs, to entice vs vnto any wickedneſle whatſoeuer, as <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife came vnto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> &amp; enticed him vnto vncleannes; we ſhall not conſent vnto him therein, no more then he did vnto her, who was kept therefrom by the feare of his God. And if any croſſe then ſhall begin to aſſault vs, and to lie heauie vpon vs, the Lord will be ready to remoue it from vs, &amp; to ſupply on the other
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:173667:98"/>ſide all our defects &amp; wants whatſoeuer. For he is alwaies preſent with them that feare him, &amp; there is no good thing, but they ſhall haue the ſame ſtom him, as you haue heard already. Wherefore looke you to this your duty, and feare ye the Lord your God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that he is your Father, your Maſter, your Sauiour, your Benefactor, your King, and one that is full of power and maieſtie, and of ſuch pure eies, that he cannot endure any corruption what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. For ſhall the child feare his father, the ſeruant his maiſter, the ſubiect his king, the poore his benefactor, the redeemed his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, the weaker his ſtronger, the baſer his more honorable, and the looſe perſons ſuch as are ſtayd and graue for religion? And yet will not you feare the Lord your God, who is all theſe vnto you? Yes, yes, we would do it, may you ſay, but what courſe ſhall we take to attaine thereunto? You muſt do theſe things. Firſt, you muſt deny your ſelues quite, and renounce vtterly all the carnall wiſedome, that is in you. As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Be not wiſe in thine owne eies, but feare God, and depart from euill.</hi> As though a man could neuer feare God, ſo long as he is well conceited of his owne wiſdome. And indeed no more ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he; For the wiſdome of the fleſh is enmitie to God, and will not be ſubiect in any ſort vnto his law. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. Secondly, you muſt pray heartily vnto the Lord for his heauenly grace to helpe you in this reſpect. For it is he alone, that muſt beſtow this feare vpon you: for otherwiſe you can neuer haue it, who of your ſelues can do nothing, no not ſo much as think one good thought, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth confeſſe of himſelfe in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you muſt often and ſeriouſly thinke on all the reaſons before going, as alſo deeply meditate with your ſelues vpon Gods feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgements, which he hath executed vpon ſinners from time to time. For this will breed in your hearts a ſenſe &amp; awe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, as we may ſee by many ſtories in the Bible, and namely by that which is written in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. where you find, that feare came on all the Church, and on as many as heard what iudgement fell vpon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> his wife, when both of them fell downe at <hi>Peters</hi> feete, and yeelded vp the ghoſt before him. Wherefore performe theſe things with care and conſcience, and no doubt, but you ſhall haue the true feare of the Lord at the laſt within you.</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:173667:99"/>
            <p> Hitherto of the firſt point, now followeth the ſecond, which is ioy. <hi>Andreioyce,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. In the entrance of the Pſalme it is euident, that they were grieued againſt the Lord, and that they did, as it were, loathe and abhorre him; but now on the contrary ſide they are willed to reioyce in him, and to be glad in his behalfe: and there is good reaſon for it too, not onely becauſe he hath ſet ſuch a good and bountifull king ouer them, as his Sonne is; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe he himſelfe is ſo ſweete a God, and his ſeruice ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and beneficial as it is. Then as men do deſire to haue their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to reioyce in them, and in their ſeruice, and to doe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they doe with chearefull hearts: ſo the Lord would haue them his ſeruants to reioyce in him &amp; in his ſeruice, and not to go about his buſines with murmuring and repining ſoules, but with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and alacritie of ſpirit. Learne we then from hence this doctrine:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that we muſt reioyce and be glad in the Lord our God, and in all that ſeruice, which we do performe vnto him. To this we are exhorted in many places of the word. <hi>Be glad ye righteous</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.11.) <hi>and reioyce in the Lord, and be ioyfull all ye that are vpright in heart.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Paul</hi> writing vnto the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> in the 4. Chap. and 4. verſe thereof, he doth ſtirre them vp vnto the ſame duty, ſaying: <hi>Reioyce in the Lord alway, againe I ſay, reioyce.</hi> But thoſe places, which are in <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.1. and in <hi>Zophonie</hi> 3.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are excellent for this purpoſe, if they be well conſidered of, and therefore (I pray) reade them at your leiſure, and marke them well.</p>
            <p>But to leaue the doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> which is cleare and cuident of it ſelfe, and to come to the reaſons of it, to conſider with our ſelues, why we ſhould do it, they are in number theſe two. Firſt, becauſe he doth excell and paſſe all the creatures in the whole world for all good things whatſoeuer. For we are wont to reioyce in ſuch things as are ſingular, and do go beyond others for goodneſſe. As for example, if a man hath a faire beautifull woman to his wife, paſſing other women for beautie or pulchritude: Or if he hath a goodly child of admirable parts to his ſonne, excelling other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for learning, and other rich endowments: Or laſtly, if he hath a ſtately commodious houſe for his dwelling, ouer-matching all other houſes in the country about him, for pompe and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:173667:99"/>vſes; how much doth he reioyce in theſe? daily experience doth teach vs, that they are the only ioy and delight of his ſoule. And euen ſo ſhould it be with vs in regard of our God: for he doth paſſe and excell all others whatſoeuer, as in wiſedome, in mercy, in iuſtice, in power, in loue, in goodneſſe, in glory, and the reſt. And therefore we ſhould reioyce in him, and make him our ſole delight and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The other reaſon is this, becauſe he doth, and alſo is moſt able to do vs moſt good, and to bleſſe vs both here in this world, and alſo in the world to come. For it is an vſuall thing with vs euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to reioyce in thoſe things, which are good and profitable vnto vs, and the more commodious and beneficiall any thing is vnto vs, the more commonly do we reioyce and delight therein. I need not demonſtrate this vnto you by any examples. For you know it too well your ſelues. Doubtleſſe, if any of vs haue but a friend, who is alwayes kind and louing vnto vs, as being ready ſtill with his horſe to lend it vs, with his plough to labour for vs, with his money to lay it out vpon vs, and with his body to go and come at our deſire for our profite and emolument, we cannot but greatly reioyce in him, and be exceeding glad, that euer we met with ſuch a good and faithfull friend. But behold (dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) the Lord our God doth paſſe him by many and infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: for all that we haue we haue from him, he doth neuer faile vs, but he doth helpe vs euery day and night, and he is able to do vs good for euermore; to bleſſe vs here, and all that we haue, and to crowne vs with glory hereafter in the heauens aboue, where ſhall be ioy, and no ſorrow; health and no ſickneſſe; holineſſe and no wickedneſſe; glory and no ſhame; riches and no pouerty; life and no death; and in one word, happineſſe, and no miſery. And therefore there is great cauſe why we ſhould reioyce and be glad in him.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> This then plainly reproueth ſuch as take their delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in worldly matters, and in the vanities of this life, but not in the Lord, nor his wayes. Some you ſhall find reioycing in their wiſdome; ſome in their riches; ſome in their ſtrength; ſome in their parentage; ſome in their honors; ſome in their ſports; ſome in one thing and ſome in another: but few in the Lord and his ſeruice.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:173667:100"/>But this is condemned you may ſee in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 9.23.24. where the Lord doth forbid the wiſe man to glory in his wiſedome, and the ſtrong man to glory in his ſtrength, and the rich man to glory in his riches; and doth command all to glory in him, and his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſay, <hi>Let him that reioyceth, reioyce in the Lord.</hi> 1. Cor. 1.31. &amp; 2. Cor. 10.17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as this doth controlle them, who take no pleaſure in the Lord, but do go about his ſeruice with vnwilling and heauie hearts, like vnto the Beare, that is drawne to the ſtake: ſo it doth teach vs, that that is but a ſlaunder, which is caſt out againſt vs, when men ſay, that Religion breeds melancholy, and cuts off all mirth and ioy. For here you ſee, we are called vpon to reioyce: and this ioy alſo that is in vs, is exceeding large and great. For <hi>Peter</hi> doth ſhew, that it is vnſpeakable and glorious in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. when he ſaith, that <hi>we do beleeue in Chriſt, though we ſee him not, and do reioyce in him with ioy vnſpeakable and glorious.</hi> And <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo doth ſhew (in chap. 9.3.) that it is like the ioy in harueſt, and as men reioyce, when they diuide a ſpoyle. True it is, that religion doth cut off all wicked and prophane mirth and ioy; but as for that, which is holy and good, conſiſting in the Lord and vpright waies, it doth bring that in, and daily increaſe it in our ſoules. For as <hi>Paule</hi> doth teach vs in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The kingdome of God ſtandeth not in meate and drinke, but in righteouſneſſe, and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> As here is righteouſneſſe in the Church or Kingdome of God, ſo here is peace and ioy, which the holy Ghoſt doth worke in the hearts of men. You may ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.3. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 106.5. that reioycing doth belong to the people of God. <hi>But the righteous</hi> (ſaith the Prophet in the former of theſe two places) <hi>ſhall be glad and reioyce before God, yea they ſhall leape for ioy.</hi> And againe he ſaith in the latter of them: <hi>Remember me, ô Lord, with the fauour of thy people, viſit me with thy ſaluation, that I may ſee the felicity of thy cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and reioyce in the ioy of thy people, and glory with thine inheritance.</hi> The muſicke that was vſed vnder the Law in the Temple may well declare this thing: for that was typicall, and figured out the true ioy and mirth, which ſhould be in the Chriſtian Church, where is the aſſurance of the remiſſion of ſinnes, and life eternall. Surely to ſpeake all in one word, Gods children haue more ioy of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:173667:100"/>heart then the wicked haue, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth declare in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. and this their ioy alſo is of longer continuance: for it ſhall neuer be taken from them, as our Sauiors words do import, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.22.</p>
            <p>Finally, out of this we may learne, to ſtzine againſt our ſorrow and penſiueneſſe, that ſo we may reioyce ſtill in the Lord and his wayes. For ſeeing we are called vpon for this duty, we muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. We muſt reioyce and be glad in the Lord, as the Church doth ſpeake of her ſelfe in the <hi>Canticles, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Howſoeuer we may mourne ſometimes for our ſinnes, and be penſiue for our tranſgreſſions: yet we muſt not ſuffer our ſorrow to ouercome vs, but we muſt ouercome it, and breake out into ioy and mirth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. And this our ioy and mirth muſt not be in feaſting, in playing, and in wickedneſſe, according to the courſe of this world, but it muſt be in ſpirituall matters, and in the holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of religion, which do belong vnto the Lord. We muſt go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the buſineſſe of our God, and his holy ſeruice, as chearfully, and as willingly as if we went vnto a feaſt; and take as great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure therein, as we do in any banquet whatſoeuer; according vnto the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and others, ſpoken of in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 42.4. who are ſaid there to go into the houſe of God with the voyce of ſinging and praiſe, as a multitude that keepeth a feaſt. And that this may the better be performed of vs, we muſt firſt labour to be fully reconciled vnto God, &amp; to be aſſured that he is become our God and Sauiour. For otherwiſe we ſhall neuer reioyce in him aright, but rather deteſt and abhorre him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt know and remember, that the ſeruice which he doth require of vs, is a reaſonable ſernice; and that there is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward layd vp for them which ſhall do the ſame. For otherwiſe it will be grieuous and irkſome vnto vs; but this will make it eaſie and pleaſant, and as ſweet to vs, as the hony, or hony combe; as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth ſpeake of it in regard of himſelfe, in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.10. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke (I pray) vnto both theſe things, that ſo the Lord and his ſeruice may be vnto you, the very ioy, and reioycing of your hearts. And in any caſe be neuer quiet or at reſt, vntill you haue brought your hearts to this, euen to reioyce in the Lord your God, as it is here in our text required of you. For this ioy being once had, will be maruellous commodious and beneficiall vnto
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:173667:101"/>you. For firſt, it will bring comfort vnto you in the midſt of all your troubles, and take away the ſharpneſſe thereof from your ſoules. Secondly, it will helpe the good eſtate of your bodies, and make them the more ſtrong and healthfull. For <hi>a ioyfull heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.22.) <hi>cauſeth good health, but aſorrowfull minde drieth the bones.</hi> Thirdly, it will fit you for the ſeruice and worſhip of the Almighty, and cauſe you to be very prompt &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in doing the ſame. For the heart is fitteſt for holy duties, when it doth reioyce, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> was to propheſie when the muſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an plaied. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 3.15. Finally, it will confirme you in your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religion, and ſo eſtabliſh you in the ſame, that you ſhall neuer ſhrinke away from it while you liue. For we are neuer weary of that, wherein we do reioyce, but the more we do the ſame, the more greedy ſtill are we for to do it, and it is a kinde of death vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs for to leaue it. And yet wil you not for all this reioyce in the Lord? Remember your ſelues, and labour for to do it, and giue no reſt (I ſay) vnto your ſoules, vntill you can bring it to paſſe. And ſo I come vnto the laſt poynt, which is <hi>Trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we muſt reioyce in the Lord, nothing doubting of his loue and good will towards vs, ſo we muſt tremble before him, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying our ſelues with all reuerence and lowlineſſe towards him, as it doth be come vs. And therefore the Prophet doth adde, <hi>in trembling. Reioyce</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>intrembling.</hi> It is manifeſt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the Pſalme, that they were high-minded, and ſtout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, in that they did take vp weapons and armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: but now the Prophet would haue them to tremble and quake before him, and to do all ſeruice vnto him with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe and lowlineſſe of minde. Where there is ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, there oftentimes do men forget themſelues, and become too bold and malapert. Now, leſt they ſhould do the like, they are commanded here not onely to reioyce in the Lord, but alſo to tremble before him, that ſo there might be found in them no lightneſſe or wanton behauiour, but all reuerence and graue carriage whatſoeuer, with an humble ſoule, not lifting vp themſelues in any of their workes, but euen trembling before him, that is the Iudge of the world. Whence we collect this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that euery perſon muſt quake and tremble before the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:173667:101"/>Almightie. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes in <hi>Philipp.</hi> 2.12. that we muſt worke out our ſaluation with feare and trembling. There are two great euils which do hinder mans ſaluation. The one is carnall ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: the other is the pride of the minde. Carnall ſecuritie makes a man too negligent in the doing of good workes, and doth cauſe him oftentimes to fall into many offences, and ſinnes. And pride doth make him too arrogant in his good workes, when he hath done them, and cauſeth him often to attribute that vnto himſelfe, which doth belong onely vnto the Lord and his grace. Herein the diuell hath a great ſtroake, and skill. Firſt, he laboureth to keepe vs from good workes, by making vs ſecure and careleſſe. Then ſecondly, if he cannot preuaile therein, he endeuoureth to make vs proud of our good workes, by lifting vp our ſoules with an high conceipt therein. Againſt both theſe doth the Apoſtle here go about to arme the <hi>Philippians.</hi> Firſt, ſetting feare againſt carnall ſecuritie: then, trembling againſt the pride of minde. And as there the Apoſtle dealeth, ſo doth the Prophet here in our text. He would not haue vs onely to feare the Lord, but alſo to tremble before him. The like in effect we haue in <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 12.38. Where the Apoſtle ſheweth, that ſeeing we doe receiue a kingdome, which cannot be ſhaken, it is our part to haue grace, whereby we may ſo ſerue God, that we may pleaſe him with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and feare. So that nothing muſt bee done in the ſeruice of God lightly or arrogantly, but all with great reuerence, and humbleneſſe of minde, whereby we tremble before him and feare his iudgements.</p>
            <p>The reaſons hereof are two. The one is,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> becauſe the Lord doth delight in ſuch, and regard them much, as we may ſee by his words in <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.2. when he ſaith: <hi>And to him will I looke, euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my words.</hi> For we muſt alwaies do that, which will be well pleaſing vnto God, &amp; cauſe him to take a delight and pleaſure in vs, conſidering that his loue is better then life it ſelfe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. The other is, becauſe the Lord doth reſiſt the proud, and ſuch as be arrogant, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any caſe endure them; as may be ſeene by our Sauiours words, when he made mention of the bragging Phariſie, &amp; poore Publican, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For after he had ſhewed what both of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:173667:102"/>them had done, and how the latter of them was more iuſtified in the ſight of God then the former, he gaue this reaſon of it, ſaying: <hi>For euery man that exalteth himſelfe ſhal be brought low, &amp; he that hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelfe ſhall be exalted.</hi> For we muſt euermore auoyde that which will caſt vs out of the fauour of God, and bring his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon vs.</p>
            <p>This then may ſerue to pull them downe who are proud and hautie.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> 
               <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Habakuk</hi> in chap. 2.4.) <hi>he that lifteth vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his minde is not vpright in him.</hi> There is no goodneſſe in ſuch. They can neuer ſerue the Lord aright, but they will alwaies marre euery good thing which they take in hand. Looke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen in holy aſſemblies; if they tremble not before the Lord, nor quake at his iudgements, you ſhall finde them enermore vnreuerent therein. They will neither be attentiue, neither yet will they bow and becke, as they ought to do: either they will talke, or ſleepe, or gaze about, or reade of ſome other matter in a booke, then of that which is in hand; or thinke on things at home or abrode, or go out before all is ended; or laugh and grin when they ſhould rather mourne and weepe, or do the like; yea when they ſhould kneele lowly vpon their knees, they either fit or ſtand, or bow their bodies but a little. Such vnreuerence and ſtoutneſſe is found amongſt them from time to time.</p>
            <p>But here for our ſelues, we muſt learne to be humble and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Chriſt our Sauiour was. And as we looke to be reſpected by God, and not to be plagued by him, we muſt labour to draw our hearts vnto a trembling and a quaking before him, that ſo we may carry our ſelues reuerently in his worſhip at all times: and when we haue done all that we can doe, not truſt in any thing, but think our ſelues to be vnprofitable ſeruants, and to come too ſhort of our duties by many degrees. But what ſhall we do, will you ſay, to attaine to this? We muſt performe theſe things. Firſt, we muſt pray to God, that hee would humble vs, and beſtow vpon vs meeke and lowly hearts. For by nature all of vs are proud and arrogant, like to <hi>Euah</hi> our firſt mother, who would not be ſubiect to God, but be as God herſelfe: and of our ſelues we cannot be humble and lowly when we would be, but God muſt humble vs and make vs lowly; who ſaid in <hi>Zophonio</hi> 3.12. <hi>Then will I leaue in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:173667:102"/>the mids of thee an humble and poore people, and they ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord.</hi> Secondly, we muſt conſider often with our ſelues, how baſe and vile we our ſelues are, and how glorious and full of Maieſtie the Lord is. For by this conſideration it may come to paſſe, that we ſhall caſt our ſelues downe before him in moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; ſubmiſſiue maner, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, when he acknowledged, that he was not worthy to ſpeake vnto the Lord, becauſe he was but duſt and aſhes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. And as <hi>Eſay</hi> did, when he cried out and ſaid: <hi>Woe is me, for I am vndone; becauſe I am a man of polluted lips, and I dwell in the mids of a people of polluted lips. For mine eyes haue ſeene the King and Lord of hoſts.</hi> Eſay 6.5. Thirdly, we muſt alwayes remember, that all the ſeruice which we can do vnto the Lord, is due vnto him; that our beſt righteouſnes is as a polluted garment; &amp; that if the Lord ſhould enter into iudgement with vs, to reward vs according to our wayes, we could not anſwer him one for a thouſand, or be able to ſtand before him, or appeare iuſt in his ſight. Laſtly, we muſt ſet before our eyes all the iudgements of the Lord, which he hath executed vpon men for their tranſgreſſions, and which he hath in great ſtore for all ſuch, as ſhall ſtand ſtoutly out againſt him, and breake his commandements. For they may quaile vs, and breake the ſtony rocke of our ſoules to peeces, and make vs cry out with <hi>Habakuk,</hi> ſaying: <hi>When I heard, my belly trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, my lips ſhooke at the voyce, rottenneſſe entred into my bones; and I trembled in myſelfe, that I might reſt in the day of trouble. For when he commeth vp vnto the people, he ſhall destroy them.</hi> Hab. 3.16. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber theſe things, and performe them.</p>
            <p>Thus farre for the duty belonging vnto God the Father: now followeth the duty, which belongeth vnto God the Sonne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſider firſt, what muſt be done vnto him, then the Reaſons to moue vnto the ſame. The duty to be performed is this; they muſt <hi>Kiſſe the Sonne.</hi> The vſe of a leiſſe in the holy Scripture is twoſold, one of ſubiection, as in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.1. where it is ſayd that <hi>Samuel</hi> did kiſſe <hi>Saul,</hi> when he annointed him to be king of Iſrael: for this was in token of his ſubiection vnto him. And in this ſence alſo is it taken in 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. where the Lord told the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> that he had left 7000 in Iſrael, whoſe knees had not bowed vnto <hi>Baal,</hi> and whoſe mouth had not kiſſed him. Another of loue and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:173667:103"/>kindneſſe, as in <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 45.15. where you find <hi>Ioſeph</hi> kiſſing all his brethren, and weeping vpon them: for this was in token of his loue and good will, which he did beare towards them. And ſo alſo is it taken in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.16. where the Apoſtle doth will the Saints to ſalute one the other with an holy kiſſe. Here in this place it may be taken in both the ſignifications: for it was their part both to loue Chriſt, and alſo to be ſubiect and obedient vnto him. And therefore they muſt kiſſe him, not onely in ſigne of homage and ſubiection, but alſo as a ſure pledge of their loue and faithful truſt, which they will performe towards him. Yet chiefly the former of theſe is meant, and not the latter. Howſoeuer, from hence we gather this doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that as we muſt honour and ſerue the Father, as we were taught in the former verſe, ſo we muſt honor and ſerue the Sonne, as you ſee here plainely in this verſe. The ſame doctrine doth our Sauiour himſelfe beate into mens heads in the firſt chapter accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpel, and the 23. verſe thereof, where he doth ſet downe a reaſon, why the Father iudgeth no man, but hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted all iudgement vnto the Sonne: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all men ſhould honor the Sonne, as they honor the Father:</hi> and thereupon doth conclude, that he that honoreth not the Sonne, the ſame honoreth not the Father, which hath ſent him.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons for this doctrine are two.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> One becauſe he hath redeemed vs, and ſet vs free by a deare ranſome from all our enimies. As the men of Iſrael ſaid to <hi>Gideon, Reigne thou ouer vs, both thou and thy ſonne, and thy ſonnes ſonne; for thou hast deliuered vs out of the hands of</hi> Midian. <hi>Iudges</hi> 8.22. So wee may ſay to him in this reſpect, Reigne thou ouer vs, both thou and thy Spirit, and thy Spirits holy word; for thou haſt deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs out of the hand of the diuell. And this is the reaſon that is preſſed in the fift chapter of the <hi>Reuelations,</hi> by all the Saints and Angels that are in heauen, why Chriſt is worthy of honour and glory, euen becauſe he was killed, and by his bloud hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs to God, and made vs Kings and Prieſts vnto him. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſhew, that this was the end wherefore he died for vs and roſe againe, namely, that he might be Lord both of the dead and quicke, as it is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. The other reaſon is this, becauſe he will hereafter glorifie vs, and take vs to himſelfe vp
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:173667:103"/>into the heauens, where he is, according to his promiſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beginning of the 14 chapter of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell. For this is the reaſon, which he vſed vnto his Apoſtles, to encourage them on vnto all dutifull ſeruice vnto himſelfe, in the latter end of the 19. chapter of <hi>Mathew.</hi> For when they did aske him, what they ſhould haue, which had forſaken all to follow him, he anſwered them and ſaid: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily, I ſay vnto you, that when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his Maieſtie, yee which followed me in the regeneration, ſhal alſo ſit vpon twelue thrones, &amp; iudge the twelue tribes of Iſrael. And whoſoeuer ſhall forſake houſes, or brethren, or fisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my names ſake, he ſhall receiue an hundred fold more, and ſhall inherite euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vſe hereof is firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> to teach vs the woefull eſtate of all <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and others who know not Chriſtaright, nor yeeld any reuerence or worſhip vnto him, as vnto God the Father. For, as after it doth follow, they muſt needs periſh and be deſtroyed for euer. There is no ſaluation or life eternall to be had of them, but they ſhall be ſure to be damned in hell for euermore. For as it is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.18. <hi>Euery one that doth not beleeue in him, is condemned already.</hi> And as it is in 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>he that hath not the Sonne of God, hath not life:</hi> he meanes eternall life, for of that did he ſpeake in the former verſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this muſt awaken vs vp all, and ſtirre vs to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of all ſuch duties, as we do owe vnto the Son: we muſt not onely know what he is aright, either in regard of his perſon, or of his office, but we muſt withall performe all loyall and faithfull ſeruice vnto him. We muſt kiſſe him, that is, ſoundly loue him, and carefully obey him in all his commandements. Learne we then his ſtatutes, and let vs euermore obſerue and keepe them. Whereas he hath a yoke, &amp; hath commanded vs to take the ſame vpon vs, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.29. let vs not fling it away, or withdraw our neckes therefrom, but with patient ſoules let vs ſubmit our ſelues vnto it, knowing that we muſt obſerue and keepe whatſoeuer he hath commanded vs, as it is in <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. Happy were we if we could once ſay to Chriſt, as the children of Iſrael did to <hi>Ioſuah</hi> ſaying: <hi>All that thou haſt commanded vs, we will do; and whitherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:173667:104"/>thou ſendeſt vs, we will go; whoſoeuer ſhall rebell againſt thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and will not obey thy words, in all that thou commandeſt, him, let him be put to death.</hi> Ioſuah 1.16 17.18. Cauſe there is great wherefore we ſhould do this. For what? Shall he die a curſed and ſhamefull death for vs, to deliuer vs from hell and damnation? and yet ſhall not we obey him? and through loue do his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements? Againe, doth he daily beſtow vpon vs great benefites? and do we looke to be glorified by him at the laſt? and to haue glory and honour, and immortality through his meanes? And yet ſhall not we loue him? and be well content to take vp his yoake, and to do whatſoeuer he ſhall command vs? But yet alas we do diſhonour him continually; we can blaſpheme his name and ſweare by his wounds and blood, and vſe his titles of Chriſt and Ieſus vnreuerently: but where is a man almoſt that doth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him aright, and loue him as he ought to doe? What? Could <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and all the States men of his Prouinces make a law, that whoſoeuer would not fall downe before the golden image which they had made, and worſhip the ſame, ſhould be caſt into an hot fiery furnace, and there be conſumed to death? And ſhall not we ſo much as diſlike with our ſelues, and inflict ſome puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon our owne perſons, when we cannot bring our ſoules to fall downe before Ieſus Chriſt, the moſt glorious image of God the Father, and worſhip him? For as for that image, it was nothing elſe but a dead peece of gold, and a matter of deteſtable idolatry, to be abhorred of euery one. But as for this image, it is a liuing and a mighty God, and a thing of great ioy to all the world, to be embraced of all perſons, as bringing life &amp; bleſſedneſſe vnto all. To conclude this point, I beſeech you deare brethren, euen as you regard your owne ſaluation, and happineſſe for euermore, loue him, and do whatſoeuer you can for him; and call him not onely your Lord, as many do, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him alſo as your Lord, as few do; and fulfill all his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements from time to time, as you ought to do.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the reaſons, which may moue you hereunto. In number they are two.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> The one is taken from the euill or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, which otherwiſe will happen vnto vs, if we doe neglect this our duty towards Chriſt. The other is drawne from
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:173667:104"/>the benefite or commodity, which we ſhall enioy, if we do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, as we ought to do. The former of theſe is ſet downe in theſe words, <hi>Leſt he be angry, and ye periſh in the way, when his anger ſhall ſuddenly burne.</hi> The latter in theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed are all that truſt in him.</hi> Both theſe do yeeld vs a large field to walke in, but I will be very ſuccinct and briefe in handling them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leſt he be angry</hi> (ſaith the text) that is, leſt he be offended and diſpleaſed with you for it. Here is the firſt euill or inconuenience that will fall out vpon the neglect of our duty vnto Chriſt. It will cauſe him to be angry, and much offended with vs for it. <hi>(And ye periſh)</hi> that is, leſt you your ſelues be deſtroyed, and come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Here is the ſecond euill or inconuenience that will fall out vpon the paſſing ouer of our obedience vnto him. He will not ſpare vs, but he will puniſh vs and deſtroy vs for the ſame. And this deſtruction of ours is amplified by two things. The firſt is by the circumſtance of the time: for as we ſhall periſh, ſo ſhall we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the way, that is, before that we can come to our iourneyes end, and fully accompliſh ſuch things as we go about, and do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to performe; which no doubt will be a great griefe vnto vs. For it is a griefe vnto a man to periſh at any time, but a greater griefe by farre is it vnto him, to periſh in the midſts of his buſines, and to be cut off by death, or any other iudgement of God, before he can diſpatch ſuch matters as he is moſt deſirous for to do. The other is by the ſuddenneſſe of it, or rather by the certaintie of it, touched in theſe words, <hi>When his wrath ſhall ſuddenly burne,</hi> or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reade it, <hi>If his wrath ſhall burne though neuer ſo little.</hi> Of theſe two readings the latter is the beſt, as moſt agreeing with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the place, and the words in the Hebrew text: for they are theſe, <hi>Chi ijbegar chimengat,</hi> that is in our Engliſh tongue word for word, <hi>when he ſhall burne, though but a little;</hi> or thus: <hi>though he ſhall be wrathfull, albeit neuer ſo little.</hi> The laſt word of all called <hi>chimengat</hi> doth not ſignifie ſuddenly, as it is tranſlated in our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but it doth ſignifie though neuer ſo little or but a little; for it is compounded of <hi>chi</hi> and of <hi>mengat,</hi> the which <hi>mengat</hi> doth come of the verbe <hi>Mangat,</hi> that importeth to diminiſh, or to make ſmall. And hereby I ſay, the certainty of their perdition is noted out: for if they ſhall periſh when he is but a little angry, they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:173667:105"/>looke to eſcape that do anger him greatly, and prouoke him datly to wrath by their ſins and diſobedience,; but be aſſured of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as the coate that is vpon their backe: as it is in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe. Thus in a few words you ſee, that there are two euils or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, which fal out vnto all ſuch as wil not loue Chriſt, &amp; obey him. The one is the anger of Chriſt againſt ſuch; &amp; the other is his iudgments proceeding from that anger, which he wil powre downe vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their vtter ouerthrow &amp; deſtruction. And both theſe are vrged by the Prophet, to draw vs to all dutifull ſeruice &amp; ſubiection vnto him. Wherfore let vs conſider here firſt, what is noted of Chriſt &amp; of thoſe that wil not ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto him, as they ought to do: then ſecondly, what vſe we muſt make therof.</p>
            <p>Touching the former of theſe, there are foure things noted and ſet downe. The firſt is, that Chriſt will be angry with men, that do diſobey him. Looke how we are offended and diſpleaſed with our children and ſeruants, and ſuch others as are vnder vs, when they are ſtubburne and wilfull, refuſing to do our commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to ſubmit themſelues vnto vs: So is Chriſt Ieſus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour offended and diſpleaſed with all ſuch, as will not do homage vnto him, and walke according to his commandements, but will do whatſoeuer ſeeme good in their owne eyes, &amp; follow the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of their owne hearts. The ſecond is, that he will not ſpare ſuch, but deſtroy them, and bring moſt heauy plagues and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon them. For howſoeuer they may flouriſh and proſper for a time, yet in the end they muſt come to perdition. As we, when we are angry &amp; wrathfull with our people for their tranſgreſſions and offences againſt vs, do beate them and lay them on, according to the qualitie and quantitie of their deſerts: So will Chriſt deale with them, that breake out daily againſt his Maieſtie, and will not ſubmit themſelues vnto his gouernment; he will take them and beate them, and lay them on ſtroke vpon ſtroke, vntill he hath cruſht them all to peeces. The third is, that the wicked ſhall neuer accompliſh their purpoſes to the full, but in the very way, as they are going about their practiſes, they ſhal be arreſted, &amp; be brought to perdition, like the fiſhes, that are taken ſuddenly in the net, and the birds that are caught in the ſnare, euen while they hunt after their prey, and do ſeeke for food to nouriſh themſelues withall.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:173667:105"/>The fourth and laſt is, that though Chriſt be mercifull, and the ſweet Sauiour of the world, and ſo full of loue and compaſſion, that he was content to lay downe his life for his enimies; yet when he is once angry, albeit but a little, there is nothing but death &amp; deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with him. His wrath is like the roaring of a Lyon, howſoeuer his fauour be like the dew vpon the graſſe; and he that prouoketh him to anger ſinneth againſt his owne ſoule. This, euen this, all ſhall confeſſe at the laſt, when the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe Captaines, and the mightie men, as well as others, ſhall hide themſelues in dens and among the rockes of the mountaines, and ſay to the mountaines &amp; rocks: <hi>Fall on vs, &amp; hide vs from the preſence of him, that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe. For the great day of his wrath is come, and who can ſtand?</hi> as it is in the latter end of the ſixth chapter of the booke, called the <hi>Reuelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe points are worthy to be ſtood vpon, but I will referre them to your owne meditations.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> The vſe that we muſt make of them is this, that we ſtire vp our ſoules by the due conſideration thereof, to the true ſeruice and worſhip of Chriſt, that ſo we may honour and kiſſe him, as it doth become vs. For they are alledged (you ſee) for this end and purpoſe. Wherefore let them awaken and rouze vp your ſoules vnto this your duty. For why ſhould you anger your ſweet Sauiour! or procure death and damnation to your ſelues! You will do many things to pleaſe your friends, &amp; runne (as we ſay) through thicke and thin, to auoide their wrath and anger, who are in authority ouer you, and may worke you a diſpleaſure at their wils: and will you not then labour to pleaſe Chriſt, who is your deareſt friend in all the world? and to do any thing to eſcape his wrath and anger, who hath all ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer you, and who may plague you euery houre at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Againe, you will abſtaine from many things for feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and do ſundry matters, which are euen contrary to your nature and likings, to auoide ſhame and deſtruction: and will you not then become obedient vnto Chriſt, abſtaining from ſuch ſins, as he hath condemned, &amp; performing ſuch duties as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that he may not puniſh you and bring ſhame and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vpon you for euermore? I pray, thinke on theſe things moſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:173667:106"/>throughly, &amp; let them haue a moſt deepe &amp; ſerious meditation in your ſoules, to do them good. And ſay not with your ſelues, that Chriſt is mercifull, and that therefore we ſhall do well, and ſee no euill, howſoeuer we do offend; for he will forgiue vs all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs to fauour againe. But remember alwayes what is in our text, namely, that he will be angry with vs, vnleſſe we do kiſſe him, &amp; that if his wrath burne neuer ſo litle, we muſt needs periſh, and that in the way, before we can bring our worke to an end. Oh deceiue nor your owne ſoules, he is euen a conſuming fire to burne vp all thoſe that do diſobey him. <hi>Thoſe mine enimies</hi> (ſaith he in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27.) <hi>which would not that I ſhould reigne ouer them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> He will take then no pitty or compaſſion vpon any, but he will breake and bruiſe all to peeces, who ſhall lift vp themſelues againſt him, be they, whatſoeuer they be; and therefore ſubmit you yourſelues vnto him, if not for loue, yet for feare of his iudgements, which are moſt intollerable; ſome in this world, and others in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus touched the reaſon, which is drawne from the dammages which will come to men, that will not obey Chriſt: let vs now deſcend vnto that reaſon, which is deriued from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity which they ſhall receiue, that will obey him. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>are all that truſt in him.</hi> Though others do periſh, &amp; are deſtroyed, who do withdraw their hearts from him: yet bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy are thoſe, that do depend vpon him, and make him their only truſt and confidence, they ſeruing him aright, as it doth become them. For here it ſhould ſeeme that the word <hi>truſt,</hi> which is a principall part of that worſhip and ſeruice, which man doth owe to Chriſt, is put for the whole worſhip and ſeruice it ſelfe, by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> when one part is put for all. And well might the Prophet vſe this word before all others, in regard of the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he ſpake of before, to note, that the godly, who haue a care to obey Chriſt, haue good hope and truſt in him, euen in the midſt of dangers; that howſoeuer he be angry, and in his anger doth deſtroy all others round about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he will ſpare them, &amp; do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good. And indeed, Chriſt is not as ſome cholericke men are, who in their rage oftentimes will lay on thoſe that are cleare and innocent, as well as ſuch as are guilty, and haue committed the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:173667:106"/>faults: but he is one that will put a difference betwixt men, and do good to thoſe, that do depend vpon him, and are obedient to his will, though he doth in his rage deſtroy the wicked, and all ſuch as do rebell againſt him. Howſoeuer, here we learne this doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that they are bleſſed and happy, that do relie vpon Chriſt, &amp; make him their ſtay and refuge. <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ieremy</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 17.7.) <hi>that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is. And bleſſed is he</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.5.) <hi>that hath the God of</hi> Iacob <hi>for his helpe, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God.</hi> But more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt (whereas theſe places ſpeake in generall of the whole Godhead) marke what the Church doth confeſſe of him in the ſecond chapter of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and the third verſe thereof. <hi>Like the apple tree</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>among the trees of the forreſt ſo is my welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued among the ſonnes of men: vnder his ſhadow had I delight, and ſate downe, and his fruit was ſweet vnto my mouth.</hi> Behold, ſhe notes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, by a notable compariſon, the excellent commodities that ſhe doth receiue by Chriſt her husband, and the happy eſtate, that ſhe doth enioy through his meanes.

            <p>And the reaſon thereof is this, becauſe they ſhall neuer periſh,

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
               </label> but haue euerlaſting life, as it is oftentimes repeated in the new Teſtament, and namely in the third of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the 16. <hi>ver.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; where God the Father is ſaid to haue loued the world ſo, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne for it, that whoſoeuer did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life. For in theſe two things all bleſſedneſſe and happineſſe doth ſtand: firſt, in a freedome from all miſery and deſtruction; then, in a poſſeſſion of all ioyes, and life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
               </label> Wherefore let euery one of vs labour ſoundly and truly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt, and to depend vpon him, as vpon a ſure rocke, that will neuer deceiue vs. For then you ſee, we ſhall be bleſſed. A man will do much to haue happineſſe here in this world, &amp; euery one by nature doth deſire the ſame. And ſhall not we then truſt in Chriſt to attaine vnto it? Withdraw we our hearts from the world,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:173667:107"/>and let vs place them wholly vpon him. As they are curſed that do make fleſh their arme, and truſt in man: ſo they are bleſſed that do make Chriſt their arme, and truſt in him. Remember what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſayd touching this matter. <hi>Loe</hi> (ſaith he to God, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27.28.) <hi>they that withdraw themſelues from thee, ſhall periſh, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeſt all them, that go a whoring from thee. As for me, it is good for me to draw neare to God; therefore I haue put my truſt in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy workes.</hi> Let theſe things moue vp our harts to cleaue faſt vnto Chriſt. Doubtleſſe there is nothing wanting in him, which is fit to be in one, on whom we are to place our truſt. There are ſixe things required of ſuch an one. Firſt, power, that he may be able to helpe vs. Secondly, will, that he may be ready to do it. Thirdly, skill, that he may know how to do it. Fourthly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that he may mind vs for the doing of it. Fifthly, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that he may not poſt it off, or neglect it from time to time. Laſtly, boldneſſe, that he may feare no inconuenience to enſue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, to hinder him from the doing of it. But all theſe are in Chriſt. He is able to helpe vs, becauſe he is omnipotent, and can do all things. He is willing, becauſe he loues vs to the death. He is skilfull, becauſe all the treaſures of knowledge and wiſedome are hid in him. He is mindfull, becauſe his eyes are alwayes open v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs; as who doth neither ſlumber nor ſleepe, but ſtand alwayes girded in the mids of the ſeuen golden candleſtickes to do them good. He is carefull, becauſe he is touched with our wants and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. Laſtly, he is bold, becauſe he is Lord and King ouer all, and that Lyon of Iudah, that feares nothing. Withdraw not then your hearts from him, but truſt in him moſt conſtantly for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by this we ſee, that godlineſſe is great gaine or riches, as the Apoſtle doth ſpeake: for truſt, here you ſee, brings with it bleſſedneſſe. It is not a barren thing, but fruitfull, it comes laden with all the bleſſings of the Lord vnto vs. Curſed man will ſay, that it is in vaine to ſerue God, and that there is no profit in keeping his Commandements, and in walking humbly before him, as it is in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. But here we are taught the contrary. The wicked that do rebell, they are caſt downe and do periſh; but as for thoſe which do ſerue Chriſt, and truſt in him, they ſtand vp,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:173667:107"/>and are bleſſed. Then for as much as your labour is not in vaine in the Lord (that I may vſe the phraſe of the Apoſtle) be ye ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, vnmoueable, abundant alway in the worke of the Lord; and truſt you in Chriſt for euermore, which will thus bring bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto you.</p>
            <p>Finally, ſeeing they are bleſſed that do truſt in Chriſt, euen then, when others periſh and are deſtroyed; we ſhould not feare at any time, but be of a good hope and comfort in the midſt of all our calamities, as knowing that then we are bleſſed and in happy eſtate, as well as at other times. For Chriſt doth know how to make a ſeparation betwixt vs that are his friends, and others that are his enimies. Queſtionleſſe, as God did put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Iſraelites and the Aegyptians, in all ſuch plagues as he ſent amongſt them, ſparing ſtill the Iſraelites, and puniſhing the Aegyptians: And as he did put a difference betwixt his ſeruant <hi>Noah</hi> and the old world, ſauing <hi>Noah,</hi> and drowning the world: And as he did put a difference betwixt holy <hi>Lot</hi> and wicked So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, deliuering <hi>Lot</hi> and burning Sodome with brimſtone and fire from heauen: So will Chriſt put a difference betwixt vs and others, to ſaue vs, and to deſtroy them; as we may ſee moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in <hi>Math.</hi> 25.32. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where it is ſaid, that he will gather all nations before him, and that he will ſeparate them one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a ſheepheard ſeparateth the ſheepe from the goates, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome to hell, and carying others with him to heauen. Let vs then neuer feare in any perill or danger whatſoeuer, whether of warre, famine, plague, or the like, leſt we ſhould periſh with the wicked hand ouer head. We ſee he hath a care of his owne, and what he will do, he can do. If it be good for vs to eſcape theſe worldly woes, we are aſſured we ſhall, as we are ſure we liue. And if otherwiſe it pleaſe him to wrap vs with others in the outward puniſhment, yet ſhall we euer be ſure to be diſtinguiſhed from them in the eternall paine; and theſe outward griefes ſhall be but meanes to leade vs to euerlaſting ioyes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore cleaue ye faſt vnto him, and feare not: be of good comfort: though others be curſed, yet you ſhall be bleſſed. For you ſee the difference of being religious, and being prophane; of louing Chriſt, and of loathing him. And this difference here will
